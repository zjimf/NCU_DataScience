# Pretest

This notebook demonstrates various basic text processing tasks using Python. It serves as an introduction to text manipulation and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features

- **Lowercase Conversion:** Converts text to lowercase to standardize the case for further processing.
- **Contraction Expansion:** Expands contractions (like "can't" to "can not") to aid in text normalization.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans text by removing HTML tags, punctuation, and numbers, preparing it for NLP tasks.
- **Tokenization:** Splits text into individual words or tokens, which are the building blocks of text analysis.
- **Stop Words Removal:** Filters out common words (such as "the", "is", "in") that are often irrelevant in text analysis tasks.

## Usage

1. **Lowercase Conversion:**

   - Input: Any string text
   - Output: Lowercased version of the text

2. **Contraction Expansion:**

   - Input: Text with contractions
   - Output: Text with expanded contractions

3. **Text Preprocessing:**

   - Input: Raw text (can contain HTML tags, numbers, etc.)
   - Output: Cleaned text, free of HTML tags, punctuation, and numbers

4. **Tokenization:**

   - Input: Clean text
   - Output: List of words or tokens

5. **Stop Words Removal:**
   - Input: Text tokens
   - Output: Tokens with common stop words removed

## Tools and Libraries

- Python programming language
- Regular Expressions (for text cleaning and contraction expansion)
- NLTK library (for tokenization and stop words removal)
