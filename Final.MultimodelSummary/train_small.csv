The accusation has been levied at the pair of sisters yet again after their their Kendall + Kylie clothing brand released an image promoting a $ 145 plaid shirt .
The photo , which has since been removed from the account , features a model with hoop earrings and her hair tied back modeling the baggy plaid shirt over a lacy bustier bra .

The part of the image causing offense is apparently the fact the shirt is only done up at the top two buttons - a style that critics claim is specific to Hispanic culture .
Immediately the image was hit with multiple comments alleging cultural appropriation , comparing it to the style of ` cholas ' or ` chongas ' .
` Now they 're trying to be cholas do they ever stop cultural appropriating ? ' wrote one angry critic .
Multiple others labelled the sisters ` culture vultures ' and questioned how they had n't ` learned ' from their previous cultural appropriation controversies .
The image has since been taken down , though neither Kylie nor Kendall have commented on the backlash .
It 's just the latest in a long line of social media frenzies over the sisters and their styles . Earlier in the summer they were hit with the accusation when they released a line of T-shirts bearing the images of several artists .
Voletta Wallace , the mother of Christopher Wallace , a.k.a. Notorious B.I.G. , was one of those who lashed out , calling the sisters ` disrespectful ' and ` exploitation at its worst ! '
Kendall and Kylie later released an apology and stopped the sale of the T-shirts , vowing to ` learn from these mistakes . '
Just last week , Kendall came under fire for cultural appropriation over her choice of emoji , of all things .

The 21-year-old supermodel was hit with a barrage of anger after her celebration of a recent magazine cover featuring her and her sisters and mother rubbed users the wrong way .
The reason for the stink ? A tanned fist emoji that Kendall tacked onto the end of her Tweet , reading : ` Sister power ... girl power . '
She wrote the words and the emoji alongside the cover of The Hollywood Reporter , which features her with her sister Kylie Jenner , half-sisters Kim , Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian and their mother Kris Jenner all wearing neutral-toned ensembles .
` Oh nah , why Kendall put her emoji as a darker skin tone ? ' wrote one user in response to the tweet .
Another raged : ` Y' all are not black . Next time use a white emoji . '
One snarky user shot back at the model by rewriting her tweet as ` cultural appropriation power . '
However , plenty of other users staged their own backlash against the backlash , with one writing : ` People are ACTUALLY mad about the COLOR of the emoji Kendall Jenner used . Surely there 's more important things to be angry about . '
Kendall has yet to respond to the remarks , but it comes just as her sister Kim revealed how hard Kendall was hit by the widespread criticism over her controversial Pepsi commercial when it debuted in April .
Kendall 's reaction to the advertisement - which came under fire for trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement - was revealed in the same cover story in The Hollywood Reporter .
The supermodel 's sister Kim , 36 , revealed while the catwalk queen , 21 , kept her emotions private , she was devastated and ` at home crying ' behind the scenes .
Kim explained in the interview , which celebrated 10 years of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on E! : ` We 're not perfect , but you see these things in the media , like Kendall and her Pepsi ad , where I see her at home crying .
` But in the media she looks another way because she 's not addressing it . '
Kendall added : ` I 'm the most private one . If there 's a moment I do n't want anyone to hear , I talk to myself or talk to someone in another room . '
Kim revealed she urged her younger sibling to speak out on the controversy or allow the emotional scenes to feature in the family 's reality show .
She added : ` I 'm just like , `` This is wrong . You need to speak up '' . She -LSB- Kendall -RSB- was like , `` I do n't ever want to show that footage of me crying '' .
` She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic , but that was what she was going through at the time . '
Referring to the moment , momager Kris Jenner , 61 , concluded : ` There are moments when it 's hard to leave something in because it 's vulnerable and it exposes us to a deeper level of emotion , and sometimes that 's hard to share . '
The drink commercial was pulled within 24 hours of its launch in April , after being met with widespread condemnation .
In the controversial commercial , Kendall was seen in the middle of a photo shoot when she happens to notice a protest march making its way down the street .
In the ad 's climatic scene , a police officer accepts a can of Pepsi from the model , and he takes a sip .
A woman wearing a nose-ring and a traditional Muslim headscarf takes a photograph and everybody cheers .

The advertisement sparked accusations that Pepsi has appropriated a racial protest movement to sell a global drinks brand .
The company pulled the commercial and issued a public apology to poster girl Kendall in the wake of the backlash .
` Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity , peace and understanding . Clearly we missed the mark , and we apologize , ' Pepsi wrote in a statement at the time .
` We did not intend to make light of any serious issue . We are removing the content and halting any further rollout .
` We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position . '",The sisters ' Kendall + Kylie clothing brand posted a photo of a model wearing a plaid shirt with just the top two buttons fastened

Anthony Dorrego , 18 , was playing basketball with friends on Sunday in Gloucester Township , New Jersey when he collapsed , NJ Advance Media reported .
Dorrego 's friends later told his family that they noticed the teen had fallen down onto his hands and knees .
Initially , they believed he was joking , but as moments elapsed , they realized the situation was more serious .
The friends called for help and a bystander from across the street raced onto the court to perform CPR .
Soon after , an ambulance arrived and rushed Dorrego to Kennedy University Hospital in Stratford .
Doctors there pronounced Dorrego dead .
A medical official later revealed to the family that Dorrego was afflicted with a previously undiagnosed heart condition .
Authorities have yet to announce the results of an autopsy .
` This is definitely a tragic thing , ' his uncle , Jimmy Loftis , said .
` He was healthy and he never complained of any issues . '
Dorrego recently graduated high school this past June .
For the past year , he was employed at a UPS shipping and receiving facility .
Dorrego was making preparations to work as a driver for the company .
Loftis said that his nephew was recently given a pay raise and that he had bought a new Nissan Maxima .
` He was really proud , ' he said .
` Anthony was a leader . A lot of his friends looked up to him , ' Loftis said .
` He was very popular , he had that `` cool guy '' personality . '
Loftis said Dorrego spent most of his time with his girlfriend , who he had been dating for four years , his cousins , and his best friends .
An avid basketball fan , he collected Michael Jordan sneakers .
` His passion was basketball . He played basketball almost every day with his friends , ' said Loftis .
Dorrego grew up in Blackwood , New Jersey . He was raised by his mother , Christine Dorrego ; his grandfather , Floyd Dorrego Sr ; and his grandfather 's wife , Kim Dorrego .
` We 're all together right now ... Still in shock , ' Loftis said .
` We 're going to stay together , stay close and get through this together . '",A New Jersey family is reeling Tuesday after an 18-year-old teen with no previous health issues died unexpectedly on a playground Sunday night

So-called teaser deals have proliferated in recent years .
They allow Britons to move thousands of pounds of debts built up elsewhere on to the cards at zero interest for periods up to 43 months .
But Bank chiefs claim the offers encourage borrowers to take on debt they may not be able to repay if the economy slumps .
That could leave card providers shouldering huge losses -- and exacerbate a downturn .
The Bank 's Financial Policy Committee meets on Wednesday to decide a course of action .
Britons have been borrowing heavily recently , with the total amount lent on credit cards , loans and overdrafts growing at nearly ten per cent a year .",Experts fear interest-free credit cards could trigger a new consumer debt crisis
4,efa330032f8ec3542641cde4987b4586387d8d8c,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is fond of oligarch Aras Agalarov because the real estate magnate ` brings him solutions , not problems , ' according to a veteran Western diplomat in Moscow .
Speaking to DailyMail.com , the diplomat revealed the video bootlegger turned-billionaire seems to be the Russian leader 's right-hand man when it comes to carrying out development projects and serving as the liaison between him and Trump .
On Tuesday , Donald Trump Jr 's bombshell email revealed that Agalarov was alleged to be the insider who wanted to pass ` incriminating ' Kremlin information about Hillary Clinton to his father 's campaign .
Initially outside the Kremlin leader 's charmed circle , Agalarov has delivered for the president in a way few other oligarchs have managed .
Putin urgently needed a new university to be built in Vladivostok , a city on Russia 's economically struggling Pacific coastline , and Agalarov 's Crocus Group met the challenge .
He required a FIFA World Cup stadium in Kaliningrad 6,475 miles west on the Baltic , plus another in Rostov-on-Don close to tinderbox eastern Ukraine .
The 63-year-old from Soviet Azerbaijan , and father of pop star Emin Agalarov , is now completing these tasks on a personal demand from Putin , without tenders .
When asked by a Russian journalist why , Agalarov gave an insight into his relationship with the all-powerful Putin : ` What do you mean why ?
` If you were told to write a specially big , good article within one day , do you say ' I ca n't ? '
' I think you take the job ... if the editor-in-chief called and said you were the only one able to do it , that you were ordered to do it , and you will do it , what do you say ? ' I ca n't ? ' Same with me . I ca n't say this . '
Agalarov - a real estate mogul famous for building high rise towers , shopping malls , and concert and exhibition venues - is a man with a greater value to Putin for doing more than delivering complex construction projects on schedule .
He turned out to be the man with deep inside knowledge about the new American president .
` All the signs are that Donald Trump and Aras Agalarov are close , and enjoy each others ' company , and this was manna to Putin , ' said the diplomat .
` What 's more , if there are skeletons in Trump 's dealings with Russia , Aras is the man who will know where they are .
` And if he knows , you would n't bet on Putin not also knowing . '
Ten days before the now infamous Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in November 2013 , Putin presented Agalarov with the Order of Honour , one of Russia 's highest civilian awards .
He received the prestigious award on the same day as another much wealthier oligarch , Alisher Usmanov , who is more of a Kremlin insider and also a shareholder in London soccer club Arsenal .
He is also a huge player in the energy industry , with mighty sway in central Asia , and is married to the woman who was mentor and coach to Putin 's alleged mistress Alina Kabaeva , the 34-year-old ex-Olympic gold winning rhythmic gymnast .
Another sign that Agalarov - who has a net worth of $ 1.92 billion - is exceptionally close to Putin , is his contract with the president to build the first section of a vital new ring road around Moscow .
The tycoon is also known to have a role in defending Russian prosecutor general Yury Chaika , when his family were accused of corruption by Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny .
Chaika was alleged this week to have wanted to get ` kompromat ' on Hillary Clinton into the hands of the Trump campaign .
The mogul is said to openly voice his support for Putin in public , more so than many oligarchs . Yet , he not a member of the St Petersburg clan or the ` siloviki ' security apparatchik fraternity to whom Putin is often drawn .
Ahead of the 2012 Russian presidential election , he publicly trumpeted his loyalty , using a treacle ladle to declare : ' I absolutely sincerely believe that , for Russia , Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the ideal option . '
He also appears to have spotted Trump 's potential to rise in US politics , and its possible significance in better relations between Moscow and Washington , ahead of many people .
It seems the tycoon had urged Putin to attend the Miss Universe Pageant to meet Trump , in 2013 .
A diary clash , as Agalarov has argued , or caution by Putin , meant a tete-a-tete did not go ahead , although Trump pretended it had .
But Putin sent his emissary to Trump in the form of his trusted friend Vladimir Kozhin , 57 , to build bridges with the future president , along with a gift of a traditional Russian lacquered box .
Kozhin - now married to glamorous 27-year-old supermodel , singer and beauty contestant Olesya Boslovyak - is currently Putin 's adviser on military and technical co-operation , but the title belies a close friendship dating back to the Russian leader 's days as deputy mayor of St Petersburg where he cut his political teeth .
He was the first friend Putin brought to Moscow from his native St Petersburg when he was made prime minister by Boris Yeltsin in August 1999 .
Kozhin was rapidly promoted four months later - when Putin became acting head of state - to lead a staff of 60,000 in charge of all presidential properties including the Kremlin .
At the finale of the Miss Universe contest , Kozhin was ensconced in a VIP area with Agalarov senior and his playboy son , singer Emin , 37 , previously married to glamorous Leyla Aliyeva , 32 , daughter of the president of oil-rich Azerbaijan , Ilham Aliyev .
Kozhin was seen ` raising vodka shots to the success ' of the $ 20million Miss Universe , said onlookers .
Since then Emin has forged his own close relations with the Trump clan as the recent email leaks show .
Emin also defended Trump from the lurid ex-MI6 spy Christopher Steele allegations of sexual misconduct , saying the president was up before dawn in Moscow to make a music video the day after the suppose ` golden shower ' performance at the five star Ritz Carlton hotel overlooking Red Square .
He posted on Instagram : ` While the world tries to figure out what Donald Trump was doing in a hotel in Moscow during Miss Universe - I actually know because he was filming my music video In Another Life ! At 7.00 am ! '
The junior Agalarov 's highly public backing for Trump ahead of the the US election has the hallmarks of his father 's support for Putin in 2012 .
It raises the question of whether Agalarov and his son were ordered by the Kremlin to voice support for his friend , the way he was instructed to build major projects for Putin .
As Emin told The Washington Post seven months before Trump 's election victory : ' I think that 's a very important sentiment , that for the first time in many years , that an American presidential potential candidate wants to be friends with another big empire . '
This , he said , could be ` an amazing breakthrough if he becomes president and actually becomes friends with Putin ... We would avoid 10 wars every year , at least , because these guys really understand that war is not maybe the way to succeed in this . '
Agalarov closeness to both Putin and Trump was at the heart of concerns by Steele that the then-presidential candidate could be compromised .
Steele 's dossier claimed that Agalarov would know about the alleged ` golden shower ' performance and the alleged of sex parties in St Petersburg , all claims Trump strongly denied .
Strangely for a media savvy oligarch , Agalarov has refused to speak on these matters .
As his aide said : ` We never commented on this matter . '
However he did act today to deny a role in seeking to feed ` kompromat ' about Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign .",Russian President Vladimir Putin is said to have taken a liking for Aras Agalarov because the oligarch was close friends with Donald Trump
5,244f37a23707ae549d2b593179444aaeb9c95578,"It is 26 years since Europe 's most prestigious football competition last visited what was once East Germany .
Back in 1991 , just a year after German reunification , Pep Guardiola lined up in midfield for Barcelona against Hansa Rostock in the European Cup . Over a quarter of a century later , the UEFA Champions League is set to touch down in Leipzig .
On Wednesday night , the biggest show in football will return to a region which once had a proud history in European competition .
The traditionalists wo n't be happy , of course . Wednesday 's fixture sees RB Leipzig take on AS Monaco . It would be difficult to find a pairing more emblematic of modern football . The perennial big-spenders of the Principality against the nouveau riche jewel in Red Bull 's football empire .
` What our opposition have over us is a significant amount of experience , ' said RB Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuttl on Tuesday . ` We need to counter that with a carefree attitude , play freely and play to our strengths . '
The freedom with which the team plays has always been RB Leipzig 's great strength .
At every stage of their remarkable , eight-year rise from non-league to Bundesliga runners-up , they have been unburdened . Unburdened by expectation . Unburdened by the familiarity of opponents and bogey-teams . Unburdened by the troubled history of East German football .
It is that freedom which has seen them rapidly move up the divisions , ever undaunted by the step up to the next level .
Now , though , they have arrived at the highest level of all . The Champions League is arguably the biggest test for a club which has risen to every challenge it has set itself since 2009 . As ever , the bosses are making sure the expectations remain sufficiently sober .
` We must n't forget that we have a very young team , ' director of sport Ralf Rangnick told kicker . ` But we should remember that Leicester City managed to get to the quarter-finals last season without any Champions League experience . '
Captain Willy Orban was also keen to paint the team as underdogs this week , saying that he thought they could ` surprise ' Monaco .
Leipzig are certainly an unknown quantity in the Champions League , much as they were in the Bundesliga last season . How they deal with the pressure of playing in three competitions and challenging Europe 's elite remains to be seen .
But they are not Leicester . This is a team with an immense amount of quality in all positions . Future Liverpool star Naby Keita will be out injured on Wednesday evening , but Hasenhuttl can still fall back on the likes of Kevin Kampl and Diego Demme in central midfield .
Up front , meanwhile , they have the brilliance of Timo Werner . The little striker 's blistering form for club and country has reportedly sparked the interest of Real Madrid in recent weeks . If he can rise to the challenge of a first Champions League season , he is a danger to any defence .
The draw has been kind to Leipzig , and progressing from a group with Monaco , Porto and Besiktas would not be the ` miracle ' which Rangnick has said it would be .
On Wednesday night , though , will be the litmus test . In Monaco , Leipzig open their campaign against the group 's toughest opponent . If they can match the French champions , then anything is possible . To do so , they will need to play as freely and fearlessly as they always have done . If there is one thing that RB Leipzig are proven experts at , it is fearlessness on the biggest stage . The Champions League , in all likelihood , is a stage , which they could be occupying for some time yet .
Many in Germany 's Eastern states will not be celebrating Leipzig 's European debut . They would rather that their region 's football had no elite clubs whatsoever than one funded by Red Bull . But an elite club RB most certainly are . This autumn may be the first time the Champions League comes to the former East Germany , but it is bound not to be the last .",RB Leipzig face AS Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday night

The world champions were all presented with their unique number before the tournament -- embroidered on a special polo shirt -- detailing where they come in English rugby 's female line of succession .
And the 35-year-old lock -- who is No 128 -- said it struck a chord with her as she prepares for her first appearance of the tournament in Dublin against Italy on Sunday .
` It is huge to know where you come in the line of players that came before you , ' said Taylor , who has 106 caps . ` To think about all those people and all those yet to come , it is a pretty special feeling .
` It does not matter if it is my fourth or my first tournament -- it is always exciting to get my shirt . '
England face the Italians after crushing Spain 56-5 on the opening day , for which Taylor was rested . The last time the sides met , in this year 's Six Nations , England won 29-15 , and Taylor warned of a backlash .
Italy , who are playing in their first World Cup for 15 years , have a shot to nothing having lost their opener 24-12 to the US .
` It will be a really competitive game , ' added Taylor . ` They have absolutely nothing to lose so we are expecting it to be a tough game . '",Tamara Taylor will appear at her fourth World Cup when England take on Italy
7,ccc07dc8f51660232297409a6857eb98c02f00fc,"They could become one of the Premier League 's most fearsome strike forces . Or Jose Mourinho could have just created an almighty clash between two heavyweight forwards .
The re-signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a one-year deal has the potential to put Romelu Lukaku 's nose out of joint .
Come October when the Swede is due back from the knee injury that ended his first season at United -LRB- although not before he scored 28 times -RRB- Mourinho will see if it is a partnership he can forge together , or one that causes needless tension .
In most instances a club signing a 35-year-old veteran on a short-term contract would cause no qualms for their new # 75million striker , one who has already scored four goals in his first three games .
He would be a back-up , the striker would assume , there in case of injury to the main man . Yet Ibrahimovic is no normal 35-year-old and he has not extended his spell at Old Trafford for a better view from the dugout than the season-ticket holders .
This is a man who posted a picture of himself dressed as Jesus locked in an arm-wrestle with a Red Devil on social media upon announcement of the deal . He is not expecting to be a ` Cup Striker ' .
When the news broke on Thursday and Ibrahimovic addressed the prospect of an issue , yet even while downplaying a potential conflict he could resist a minor dig at his rival , after giving up the No 9 shirt to him .
' I am happy he came and I think the team is much stronger this season , ' Ibrahimovic said of his team-mate . ` Signing Lukaku makes us even stronger because he has different qualities from me as a striker and from Rashford as a striker . He is a powerful guy and he will bring some extra quality in the game .
' I mean , Lukaku called me and he said , ` Bro , can I get the No 9 ? ' Ibrahimovic said . ' I said , ` Listen , I 'm not on that level where I will make it difficult for you . I just want you to feel happy and feel welcome . So I give you the No 9 . But I will take the No 10 , that 's the way we do it . ' So I never left . I just upgraded my number . '
It does n't take much to rile strikers , who can be hard on the surface but sensitive souls beneath . Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham barely shared a word during four years at United together due to a conflict of surprisingly minor conception .
` Some might be surprised our rift had such apparently mundane roots , ' Cole wrote in a column for The Independent in 2010 . ` It was early 1995 , I had recently signed for Manchester United , and it was my England debut , against Uruguay . I was a sub . I came on for Sheringham -LRB- then at Tottenham -RRB- .
' I was so nervous it was frightening . This was the culmination of a lifetime of ambition . You hear the cliché , ` It means everything to play for my country ' . But trust me , it did . ' I walked on to the pitch , 60,000 or so watching . Sheringham is coming off . I expect a brief handshake , a ` Good luck , Coley ' , something . I am ready to shake . He snubs me . He actively snubs me , for no reason I was ever aware of then or since . He walks off .
' I do n't even know the bloke so he ca n't have any issue with me . We 're fellow England players , it is my debut and he snubs me .
' I was embarrassed . I was confused . And there you have it . From that moment on , I knew Sheringham was not for me . '
Maybe it wo n't matter at all for Ibrahimovic and Lukaku . Disdain did not stop Cole and Sheringham scoring a phenomenal amount of goals as partners , winning three Premier League titles , an FA Cup and the Champions League together .",Zlatan Ibrahimovic has sealed his Manchester United return following injury
8,b59e86169bfc81b8d87abcde78f680118cfd3e6e,"Two cousins charged with the brutal deaths of four men in Pennsylvania have had numerous run-ins with the police dating back six years .
Cosmo DiNardo , a 20-year-old drug dealer with a history of schizophrenia , had 30 ` contacts ' with the Bensalem Police Department since he was 14 , department director Frederick Harran told FOX .
A year after he was committed to a psychiatric institution and prohibited by law to own a gun , DiNardo allegedly shot his first victim , Jimi Taro Patrick , 19 , on July 5 .
His cousin Sean Kratz , on the other hand , had three previous arrests for burglary and retail theft dating back to June 2016 . He was also arrested after skipping bail in January .
Kratz had been released on bail again when he allegedly killed Dean Finocchiaro , 19 , Tom Meo , 21 , and Mark Sturgis , 22 , with DiNardo on July 7 .
DiNardo , who confessed to all four murders , told authorities he moved the final two victims ' bodies with a backhoe and placed their corpses in a ` pig roaster ' , which he tried to light on fire before burying the tank with Kratz on his parents ' farm .
DiNardo was charged with four criminal homicide counts , while Kratz was charged with three . They both face multiple counts of conspiracy , robbery and abuse of corpse .
DiNardo was well known to Bensalem police after he racked up 30 run-ins over the course of six years , according to Harran .
Harran would not elaborate on the nature of the ` contacts ' , and his criminal record only shows he was arrested for having a gun in February .
DiNardo , who was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution last year , was barred from possessing a gun under Pennsylvania law .
That firearms charge was dismissed at a May 30 hearing because the paperwork was not in the proper format . It was authorized for refiling on June 21 , but DiNardo was n't arrested until Monday .
His father posted bail before he was arrested a second time for stealing Meo 's car . He remains in custody after a judge set bail at $ 5million .
Prosecutors also said DiNardo had been diagnosed with schizophrenia , and someone who knew the 20-year-old told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he had changed in recent months .
The drug dealer had hoped to study biology as an incoming student at Arcadia University in 2015 , but police were notified after he made disturbing comments on campus .
As a result , the school barred him from returning and issued a letter to his parents saying DiNardo could be charged with trespassing if he failed to comply , according to a source who spoke to AP .
Kratz , on the other hand , had been arrested for stealing $ 1,000 in tools , $ 450 in jewelry , and $ 200 in clothing in three separate incidents in 2016 .
He skipped bail and headed to Illinois in January , before he was arrested and released on bail again , according to court records cited by FOX .
Kratz was still on bail when he allegedly killed three men with DiNardo in July 7 , two days after his cousin shot the first victim , Jimi Taro Patrick .
DiNardo , who attended the same Catholic high school for boys as Patrick , offered to sell the 19-year-old a shotgun and four pounds of marijuana for $ 8,000 .
But when DiNardo went to pick Patrick up on July 5 , he only had $ 800 .
DiNardo then shot him with his mother 's gun and buried his body ` far away ' from the other three in a six-foot grave .
Two days later , DiNardo conspired with Kratz to rob Dean Finocchiaro after he arranged to sell the victim a quarter pound of marijuana for $ 700 .
Kratz shot Finocchiaro ; DiNardo fired at his body after he was already dead .
Finocchiaro 's remains were then wrapped in a blue tarp from a corn crib and he was thrown into a metal tank converted into a cooker , which he referred to as the pig roaster .
July 5 : Jimi Taro Patrick , 19 , is seen for the last time . He appears to be the first of the men to go missing .
July 7 : Dean Finocchiaro , 19 , Mark Sturgis , 22 , and Tom Meo , 21 , are all seen for the last time .
July 9 : All four men have been reported missing , and a search warrant is executed at a home in Solebury Township , where investigators find Meo 's car .
July 10 : Officials search a Solebury Township farm owned by Antonio and Sandra DiNardo . Their son , 20-year-old Cosmo DiNardo is taken into custody on firearms charges that appeared to be unrelated to the missing persons case .
July 11 : DiNardo is released on bail .
July 12 : Authorities find human remains of multiple bodies on the farm . The remains of Finocchiaro are identified . DiNardo is arrested for a second time and charged with trying to sell a vehicle belonging to one of the missing men .
Later that night , DiNardo made a deal to sell marijuana to Tom Meo and Mark Sturgis and the three met behind a church before heading to DiNardo 's property together .
Again , the cousins plotted to rob them .
DiNardo shot Meo first before taking aim at Sturgis until he ran out of ammunition .
He then drove a backhoe over Meo , who may have still been alive at the time . Kratz told police his cousin ` basically crushed ' Meo with the digger .
DiNardo used the backhoe to move the two bodies and together , the cousins put the corpses in the pig roaster with Finocchiaro , doused it in gasoline and set it on fire .
The next day , the two dug a 12.5 foot grave with the same backhoe and buried the container with the bodies inside .
DiNardo said he did so because he felt threatened or cheated when he tried to sell them marijuana , a source close to the investigation has said .
He also told police where to find the rest of the bodies as part of a plea deal that would allow him to avoid the death penalty .","Cosmo DiNardo , a 20-year-old drug dealer with a history of schizophrenia , had 30 ` contacts ' with the Bensalem Police Department since he was 14"
9,ccf503f94bff06e5b3028321ead8c227ec1230b2,"Former Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz introduced amendments that would seek to strip Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner of his security clearance .
The former DNC chair and Florida Democrat ran the organization when it got hacked in an intrusion that the intelligence community concluded was orchestrated by the Kremlin . The disclosures that ensued proved embarrassing to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , and ultimately led to Wasserman Schultz stepping down from her post .
In the aftermath of the election , it was revealed that the DNC turned down offers of assistance form the FBI and the Homeland Security Department .
` Sometime in 2016 , I became aware of a hack into systems of the Democratic National Committee , ' former Homeland Security Secrtary Jeh Johnson testified in late June .
' I pressed my staff to know whether DHS was sufficiently proactive , and on the scene helping the DNC identify the intruders and patch vulnerabilities . The answer , to the best of my recollection , was not reassuring : the FBI and the DNC had been in contact with each other months before about the intrusion , and the DNC did not feel it needed DHS 's assistance at that time . '
Wasserman Schultz offered a series of amendments , joining Democrats including minority leader Nancy Pelosi who have questioned Kushner 's ongoing security clearance , despite his undisclosed Russia meetings .
One amendment to a spending bill read : `` None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to issue , renew , or maintain a security clearance for any individual in a position in the Executive Office of the President who is under a criminal investigation by a federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government .
` Mr. Kushner did n't only leave out a couple of meetings , he 's had to amend his form three times , with over 100 meetings with foreign nationals , '' Wasserman Schultz said , Business Insider reported . She said some of those individuals ` were with the state of Russia , an enemy state . Specifically designed to aid his father-in-law 's campaign and assist him in being elected president of the United States . '
Rep. John Culberson of Texas called the amendments a ` political stunt . '
Kushner has amended a government disclosure document to belatedly reveal contacts with more than 100 foreigners .
Kushner has been providing ` updates ' to his SF-86 national security form , after it was revealed he did not disclose any foreign contacts on his initial form .
His attorney has said he is providing ` updates ' after discovering the original omission . The New York Times reported Thursday that Kushner supplemented the list three times , adding more than 100 names .
That number jibes with a recent statement by Kushner 's attorney , Jamie Gorelick , in response to revelations about Donald Trump Jr. 's meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer , Natalia Veselnitskaya . The statement essentially confirmed that Kushner had met Veselnitskaya during the meeting .
Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort also attended the June 2016 meeting -- the type of contact officials are asked to disclose when applying for a government security clearance .
According to the Gorelick statement : '' -LSB- D -RSB- uring the campaign and transition , he had over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries , most of which were during -LSB- the presidential -RSB- transition . '
She added : ` Mr. Kushner has submitted additional -LSB- federal disclosure -RSB- updates and included , out of an abundance of caution , this meeting with a Russian person , which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law , Donald Trump Jr. . As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated , he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows . '
Many of Kushner 's foreign contacts were hardly a secret . During the transition , the husband of Ivanka Trump became known as the president 's go-to person for foreign leaders .
` If this were a normal political world , Jared Kushner would n't have a job by the end of today , ' Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told The Hill .
In photos released during the transition , Kushner was pictured with an array of world leaders , as he was with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in an image released by the Japanese foreign ministry .
But his meetings with Russians are of particular interest to investigators who are probing contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russia following the intelligence communities conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election .
Kushner is now known to have had three contacts with Russians during the campaign : One with outgoing Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak , one with Veselnitskaya , and one with Sergei Gorkov , chairman of state-owned Sberbank .
The president defended his son during a Paris press conference for attending the meeting with Veselnitskaya that Kushner attended .
` My son is a wonderful young man . He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer , ' Trump said Thursday . ` It was a meeting that went very , very quickly , very fast . '
Trump said the ` press made a very big deal over something really a lot of people would do , ' then blamed former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for letting the Kremlin-linked woman into the country in the first place .
` So , again , I have a son who 's a great young man , he 's a fine person . Took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia , it lasted for a very short period and nothing came of the meeting . And I think it 's a meeting most people in politics probably would have taken ' the president continued .
The meeting occurred after music publicist Robert Goldstone contacted Trump Jr with an offer of dirt on rival Hillary Clinton and a claim that the Russian government supported his campaign .",Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner has revised a disclosure form he completed in connection with joining the White House

Gary Power posted his gripe to the airline 's Facebook page yesterday after boarding his flight to Alicante from Manchester Airport .
The tourist said he boarded the EZY1917 service at 7.10 am on Monday and was revolted when the man and women adjacent to him began their romp .
He said : ` Well done @easyjet - got on my flight from Manchester to Alicante and what happened during the flight ?

13,78e923ce9c40ac7d0e854f06b31b2d3e15ea159f,"Diehard Conservative Remainers yesterday threatened to team up with Labour to force ministers to give MPs a veto on the final Brexit deal .
Remain-supporting MPs geared up for an autumn of guerilla warfare by tabling a blizzard of amendments to the Government 's legislation .
Within hours of the flagship EU Withdrawal Bill clearing its first parliamentary hurdle yesterday , 59 pages of amendments were put down by critics of Brexit .
Ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve , who has emerged as a key figure among Tory rebels , said he was prepared to join with Labour to defeat the Government unless ministers made a string of concessions .
Mr Grieve said the Government appeared to be in ` listening ' mode . But he added : ` If it does n't -LSB- listen -RSB- then it risks being defeated in the House of Commons . I think that has to be a real possibility . '
He insisted he accepted the referendum result , but added : ` I believe leaving the EU is a great and historic mistake . '
Mr Grieve , who tabled 16 amendments to the Bill , said the new legislation ` puts far too much power in the hands of the executive ' and MPs would now ` go through it with a fine-tooth comb ' .
His amendments include a proposal backed by nine Tory MPs that would require the Government to hold a binding vote on the Brexit deal before it was agreed .
Some MPs hope the move could force Theresa May back to the negotiating table , but it could also see Britain crash out of the EU without a deal .
Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg last night accused rebels in his party of trying to frustrate the process . He said : ` The Government has already promised there will be a vote on the deal . Putting it into legislation risks creating a procedural log-jam if not outright chaos if the divorce deal is signed near the deadline .
` It appears to be a last gasp effort by the Remainers to keep us in the EU . But this would also in theory allow Eurosceptics who think no deal is better than a bad deal to vote down the agreement . '
Labour also tabled a string of amendments which would tie the Government 's hands during the negotiations on Britain 's EU exit .
Jeremy Corbyn put forward proposals to allow MPs to determine the duration of any transitional deal .
With Labour also calling for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union during any transition , this could allow pro-Remain MPs to permanently keep Britain in the EU in all but name .
Labour 's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said that the ` flawed Bill ' would require ` extensive amendment and improvement in a whole range of areas ' . He added : ` This is likely to cause delays and division in Parliament , and the Prime Minister has nobody to blame but herself . '
Pro-Remain MPs also put forward plans that would require the UK to stay in the customs union indefinitely , even though this would mean the permanent continuation of free movement .
And the Liberal Democrats are seeking to force a vote that would require the Government to hold a second referendum before leaving the EU .
Philip Hammond yesterday said a transitional deal to smooth the path to Brexit would look ` a lot like the status quo ' . The Chancellor indicated that he was pushing for an arrangement that will keep the UK in the customs union in all but name as we leave the European Union .
Ministers have agreed to pursue a transition lasting up to three years to give businesses and the Government more time to prepare .
Mr Hammond told peers ` not everything ' would be ready in time for the expected exit date in March 2019 , with customs facing a ` very challenging ' race to implement new systems .
Asked if he was confident the capacity of UK ports was adequate to deal with additional inspections , Mr Hammond said : ` No , it is clearly not . '
The EU Withdrawal Bill repeals the European Communities Act 1972 , which enshrines the supremacy of EU law . It also transfers thousands of existing EU regulations into British law in order to smooth the path to Brexit .",A total of 59 pages of amendments have been tabled for the EU Withdrawal Bill

The once-popular social network , which launched in 2003 , was quickly replaced by the likes of Facebook , Twitter and Instagram and has since faded into obscurity .
But those who still have a MySpace account are being urged to delete their account after a security expert found that old profiles are easy to hack into by criminals using basic personal details .

Last year , MySpace invalidated all passwords for accounts last used before 2013 after a hacker leaked the emails and passwords of over 360 million profiles .
Users now have to reset their password if they wish to log on , but the system is easily cheated .
The only pieces of information needed to fully reset an account 's password are the user 's name , username and date of birth .
The full name and username of an account holder can be found easily via Google .
Their date of birth can be obtained from other social media accounts or through voting records .
Leigh-Anne Galloway , a cyber security adviser based in Boston , found that the password re-call for old accounts only requires the user 's name , username and date of birth - information easily found online .
Last year , Myspace invalidated all passwords for accounts last used before 2013 after a hacker leaked the emails and passwords of over 360 million profiles .
Users now have to reset their password if they wish to log on , but Ms Galloway found the system is easily cheated .
Usually , to recover an account on a social media site users have to provide the email linked to the profile as well as some personal details .
But because so many MySpace users no longer have access to the old email they used when signing up to the site , it offers a way to recover the account without it .
MySpace 's account recovery page asks users to fill in several pieces of information in place of their old email to verify their details .
It asks for their full name , username , date of birth , new email address and the email address registered with their Myspace account as a minimum .
It says including extra , optional information , such as where the user lives , will speed up the recovery process .
However , Ms Galloway found that the only pieces of information needed to fully reset an account 's password were the user 's name , username and date of birth .
` The full name and the username of the account holder can be found from a simple google , ' she wrote in a blog post on her find .
` Username is located in the profile url , and name is located on the profile page .
` Date of birth is probably the hardest of all three to obtain , but not impossible , ' she said .
A user 's birthday could be found on a different social media site , such as Twitter or Instagram , or through voting records , she added .
Once the information is entered , Myspace lets you reset your password and log in .
Hackers can enter any email address into the 'em ail address on account ' field because the addresses are not verified against the accounts themselves .
Ms Galloway said she emailed Myspace three months ago but has received no response from the firm .
She suggested that people who still have an old account should delete it .
` It seems Myspace wants us all to take security into our own hands , ' Ms Galloway said .
` If there is a possibility that you still have account on Myspace , I recommend you delete your account immediately . '",Old Myspace accounts are easily hacked into using basic personal details

Ian Stewart drugged Helen Bailey with sleeping pills before suffocating her and dumping her body in a cess pit under the garage of their # 1.5 million home in Royston , Hertfordshire .
Ms Bailey , 51 , who wrote the Electra Brown series of books , was reported missing in April last year , but her remains were not discovered by the police until three months later .
Stewart , 56 , was later sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years after being found guilty of murder . He will not be able to apply for parole until he is 90 .
Today Stewart appeared again at St Albans crown court via a video link from Bedford prison for a confiscation hearing .
Wearing a blue shirt , he spoke only to confirm his name .
Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer QC said it has been ascertained that the only financial benefit Stewart obtained was # 10,200 that he had transferred into a joint account that he shared with his fiancée .
After her disappearance he electronically altered a standing order paid from Helen 's account from # 600 to # 4,000 a month .
He had spent # 3,154 , on renewing Arsenal FC season tickets , but the rest of the money remained in this account .
Mr Trimmer said the confiscation hearing had been delayed because the crown wanted to check that Stewart would not acquire Helen 's share of the couple 's home , Hartwell Lodge .
He said that under the 1982 Forfeiture Act , Stewart 's conviction for murder meant he would not profit from their joint tenancy .
Judge Andrew Bright QC made a confiscation order for # 5,100 - half of the money in the joint account , which is currently frozen . He told Stewart : `` You have assets that outweight that figure .

Irritable cheeks plague thousands of avid joggers , with the unpleasant sensation in their posterior often triggered by nylon rubbing .
But Finnish designers claim their new range of boxer shorts made from recycled material are a cure - both the pain and the world 's oceans .
The Other Danish Guy has unveiled its # 30 underwear designed for those men with an active lifestyle - with a female range coming soon .
Produced using fishing nets and other goods salvaged during dives , the firm behind the invention says it 's helping clean-up the world 's seas .
It offers a 100 per cent guarantee that it wo n't cause any irritable cheeks , often brought on by exercising and playing sports .
Most importantly , it says the material used is much softer and more comfortable against the skin than traditional nylon .
Recycled material

The Other Danish Guy 's founder Tommi Lähde said : ` For us , using recycled nylon yarn made from ocean garbage was a two-fold decision .
` We want to change the world for the better , and we also discovered this type of nylon is actually much softer and more comfortable against the skin .
` The fabric we use is n't cheap because of its origin ; recycled materials cost more than traditionally-made ones . '
Soft material
He added : ` But it is the softest and most breathable material of its type on the market . '

The secret is the ` SmoothShell ' material used - a revolutionary , fast-drying fabric which has an ` outstandingly soft touch ' .
Mr Lähde said the idea came after he shared a hotel room with a close friend who was suffering from extreme bum chafing .
He added : ` He 'd just got off a long haul flight and then went for a run , and because he was wearing ill-fitting pants that did n't wick away his sweat , his bum was red raw and bleeding .
' I had to watch the delightful scenes as he massaged soothing lotion into his downstairs areas before my very eyes .
` And we knew then that we could design a product to put an end to such nightmare scenarios . '
Fishing nets salvaged from the ocean floor and other industrial plastic waste is collected through a worldwide initiative .
How are they made ?
A process called depolymerisation , outsourced to an Italian firm , then turns the items into yarn .
This special yarn is then woven into the material used in the firm 's Ocean Discovery range of underwear .

Her father is reading her Harry Potter , and teachers brought her Michigan-made food , including Zingermann 's coffee cake from Ann Arbor , Michigan , and fudge from Mackinac Island .
Teachers have also decided to get her children 's book , about hospital items trying to save a girl from cancer , bound and copied .
Audrey was also brought boxes of strawberries from teachers and asked that her friends would picnic at the museum together every July .

Almost half of the 88,357 cases of flu in Australia this year have been in New South Wales , the Daily Telegraph reports .
In Queensland , dozens of extra frontline medical staff and hospital beds are being brought on amid the unprecedented flu season .
Health and Ambulance Services Minister Cameron Dick said 19,216 flu cases had been confirmed in the state this year .
Mr Dick said new models of care , an extra 90 hospitals beds and 40 additional paramedics would be brought on by September after a 13 per cent rise in emergency help calls for the flu .
` The most significant growth has been in Code 1 cases , the most critical patients , where there has been a 22 per cent increase in the past week , compared to the same period last year , ' he said .
Meanwhile , NSW health authorities say almost 10,000 people arrived at emergency departments with flu-like symptoms last week .
More than 42,000 people have been hit by flu since the start of the year -- with businesses reporting that sick employees are taking up to a week off work because of it , according to the Telegraph .
Frank Ribuot , the boss of recruitment firm Randstad , told the newspaper that it had seen a 10 per cent rise in the demand for temporary staff in recent weeks -- particularly those in ` frontline ' roles such as teachers , receptionists and customer service workers .
A single strain of flu is the usually the cause of outbreaks , but this year , there are four : two types of influenza A and two types of influenza B strains .
Dr Vicky Sheppeard , NSW Health 's Director Communicable Diseases , said people with flu symptoms should take extra care to avoid spreading their infection .
` Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue , disposing of used tissues and washing hands thoroughly and often are simple precautions people can take from spreading flu , ' Dr Sheppeard said .
` We are seeing high levels of both influenza A and B strains circulating in the community , which places vulnerable people at high risk of catching the influenza and developing severe complications . '
Dr Sheppeard said people with flu symptoms should also avoid going out unless it 's to see their doctor , and they should stay away from school and work until they have fully recovered .
Influenza , or flu , is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses .
There are three main types of influenza virus that cause infection in humans - types A , B and C - and many sub-types or strains . Influenza can occur throughout the year , but influenza activity usually peaks in winter .
Influenza is a vaccine-preventable illness but a new vaccine needs to be given each year because influenza viruses change -LRB- mutate -RRB- constantly . A new influenza vaccine is prepared each year to best match the strains predicted for the coming influenza season .
People with influenza typically experience some or all of the following symptoms : fever and chills ; cough , sore throat and runny or stuffy nose ; muscle aches , joint pains ; headaches and fatigue ; nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea -LRB- more common in children than adults -RRB- .
Some symptoms may last for more than a week . Some people may also experience very mild symptoms , particularly if they have some immunity from a previous infection or vaccination .
Seek immediate medical advice if the illness quickly becomes worse or if any of the following symptoms occur : shortness of breath or rapid breathing ; chest pain ; confusion or sudden dizziness and persistent vomiting .

All Eyes On Fry
Only 11 Under 20 English players featured in the Championship on Saturday , a hugely disappointing number for anyone looking to build the next generation of England footballers . One of the 11 was Middlesbrough 's Dael Fry , who started for the visit of Sheffield United despite a disappointing loan spell at Rotherham last campaign . Central defender Fry got away with a late own goal , incorrectly ruled out for offside , but he 'll be one to keep an eye on .
Harry draws blank
Jacques Maghoma was the match winner for Birmingham , cutting in from the left and firing home . Harry Redknapp was reminded of one man , but his player was n't taken by the comparison : ` He 's got good ability and he came inside ... I said it was like John Robertson , ' said the veteran manager . ` He did n't have a clue what I was talking about . '
Mick does the trick



As a neutral , it 's difficult not to like Mick McCarthy , who can add a joke to the oddly serious world of football which , it has to be remembered , is a game about kicking a ball .
But after a few years in the doldrums and some questionable football , Ipswich fans ended last season wanting change in the dug-out . McCarthy earned some breathing space with an opening-day win . And on his return to his hometown of Barnsley , he oversaw a two-goal turnaround -- goals scored by his two half-time substitutes .
Nightmare start
You train all week . You convince the manager to pick you . And then you fall over 26 seconds into the match and pull someone over . Tomas Kalas had a nightmare cameo appearance for Fulham against Reading . The Chelsea loanee was sent off for hauling down Mo Barrow just outside the box . Referee Simon Hooper deemed him to be denying a clear goalscoring opportunity and off he went .
Goal of the week
Andreas Bouchalakis - Nottingham Forest v Brentford
The are great debuts and then there are great debuts . Andreas Bouchalakis got off to the ideal start with a lovely edge-of-the-box volley to put Forest a goal ahead . Then later in the game the former Olympiacos midfielder swept a sublime curled left-foot shot into the top corner . Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley would have needed 10ft arms to get close .",11 Under 20 English players were fielded this weekend in England 's second tier
23,65016d94b9f492e703e244c44109c7fe88c85ec3,"Jesus Ibarra , a 19-year-old engineering student , has been barely able to walk or talk since a tear gas canister crushed part of his skull during a protest against President Nicolas Maduro and he fell unconscious into a river that carries sewage .
Chronic shortages of medicine in Venezuela forced his family to ask for drug donations so Ibarra could undergo five surgeries on his skull and treatment for infections from the Guaire river .
Ibarra , who can not return to his studies any time soon , needs to a sixth operation and therapy . It is unclear if he will fully recover .
' I speak to my son a lot , and sometimes he makes me understand it was not worth suffering this , that he regrets it , that it was a mistake , ' said Ibarra 's father Jose at their small home in the sprawling hilltop slum of Petare in Caracas .
` But other times he 's clearly telling me that it was worth fighting for a change he believes in . '
Ibarra is one of nearly 2,000 people injured during four months of fierce anti-Maduro street protests , according to the public prosecutor 's office . Rights groups think the number is probably higher .
Venezuela has been torn by political and economic crises that have led to extreme shortages of food and medicine , crushing inflation and the collapse of the local currency . Its new government structure has been criticized as a dictatorship .
Rubber bullets fired at close range , rocks , and tear gas canisters have caused most of the injuries , doctors and rights groups say . Most of those who have been hurt appear to be opposition protesters , but Maduro supporters , security forces and bystanders have also been harmed .
More than 125 people have died in the unrest since April . Thousands have been arrested .
The unpopular leftist president has said he was facing an armed insurgency intent on overthrowing him .
Opposition politicians have said they were forced to take to the streets after authorities curtailed democratic means for change . They have also accused security forces of using excessive force against protesters .
Culinary student Brian Dalati , 22 , said he was passing an opposition-manned street barricade on his way to classes in July when police mistook him for a protester . They hit him and fired buckshot at his legs , fracturing both of Dalati 's shinbones .
' I depend on my siblings to go to the bathroom , shower , brush my teeth , eat , anything . It 's infuriating , ' he said . ` They did n't have to do this . It was pure hate . Thank goodness I will be able to walk again soon . '
The government says right-wing media are too focused on injuries to protesters .
Maduro has pointed to a case in which a 21-year-old man was set afire during an opposition protest and died two weeks later . A Reuters witness said the crowd had accused the man of being a thief , but the government said he was targeted for being a Maduro supporter .
Protests have subsided since Maduro 's government established a controversial legislative superbody three weeks ago , but hundreds of Venezuelans are still struggling to nurse their wounds without medicine and state support .",Protests against deeply unpopular socialist president began four months ago

For example , of those who desire easier access to abortions , 91 percent think this will inevitably occur in the future , a study review found .
This is compared to just 47 percent among those who prefer stringent termination laws , the research adds .
Lead author Todd Rogers from Harvard University , said : ` It often seems that partisans believe they are so correct that others will eventually come to see the obviousness of their correctness .
` Ironically , our findings indicate that this belief in a favorable future may diminish the likelihood that people will take action to ensure that the favorable future becomes reality . '
Happy people are healthier , research revealed in July .
Of the numerous studies investigating an association between having a sunny disposition and improved health , 65 percent found a link , a study review found .
Researchers from the universities of Utah and Virginia believe happier people may be more inclined to live a healthy lifestyle , for instance exercising regularly or not smoking .
Alternatively , being content may directly benefit the health of the heart and immune system , they add .
Yet , the extent of being cheerful 's benefits on our health is unclear , the research adds .
How the study was carried out
Researchers from the universities of Harvard and California , Berkeley , analyzed six studies investigating people 's political views , scientific beliefs , and entertainment and product preferences .
One of the studies had its participants complete an online survey on their opinion on nine unrelated topics .
These were : abortion , gay marriage , the National Basketball Association , climate change , ideology , party affiliation , President Trump , soft drinks and phones .
They were also asked how they expect these subjects will play out in the future .
Believing things will improve hinders action
Results reveal that believing things will improve or others will come round to your way of thinking makes people less likely to take action .
For example , of those who wish for easier abortion access , 91 percent think this will occur in the future .
This is compared to 47 percent among people who want termination laws to remain stringent .
` Believe they are so correct others will come to see the obviousness of their correctness '
Mr Rogers said : ` It often seems that partisans believe they are so correct that others will eventually come to see the obviousness of their correctness .
` Ironically , our findings indicate that this belief in a favorable future may diminish the likelihood that people will take action to ensure that the favorable future becomes reality .

` People biasedly believe that others will change in ways that align with their current preferences , views , and beliefs . '

26,222ed954d570cf700c14da6d56a539acd5110149,"Barcelona terror attack suspect Younes Abouyaaqoub was looking like a ` hermit ' when he was gunned down by police after four days on the run , it was reported today .
The 22-year-old was said to be dressed in filthy clothes , suggesting that he had been living rough and had walked for around 30 miles from Barcelona across scrubland , woods and farmland to the area where he was killed .
Abouyaaquob , who was Europe 's most wanted man , was shot dead by two police officers yesterday afternoon on a footpath bordering vineyards in the Subirats district .
Younes Abouyaaqoub may have been trying to get help from an acquaintance just minutes before he was shot dead by police , it was reported today .
A villager near the scene of the shooting said his Argentinian neighbour had told him that a man resembling Abouyaaqoub was whistling from an orchard at the back of his home as if he was trying to get someone 's attention .
The local resident named only as Agustin said his neighbour looked out of the window at 4pm yesterday after hearing the whistling and saw a young man looking like he was ` half-drunk . '
The man then turned round and ` went away in another direction ' as if he was upset that he had not found who he was looking for .
Agustin told the El Pais newspaper that a Moroccan couple and their daughter who was aged around three had previously lived in the Argentinian 's house until about a year ago when they ` just disappeared ' .
He said : ` I do not know anything because , especially the man , he never talked to anyone . '
Agustin contacted the police after his neighbour told him what had happened .
He told the newspaper : ` He heard that he whistled as if to call attention , to ask for help , and he came face to face with him .
` When he came to explain , he was scared to death and I decided to call the police . '
Agustin claimed the man his neighbour had seen was wearing dark trousers , a blue shirt and black shoes with white soles .
The Moroccan national who was wearing a fake suicide belt and reportedly carrying three knives was tracked down soon after two sightings of him in the area .
Abouyaaqoub had been a fugitive since he killed 13 people and injured more than 100 by mowing them down in a hired van in the Las Ramblas tourist hot spot in Barcelona last Thursday .
Police finally found him on the footpath on the outskirts of the wine-producing town of Sant Sadurni D'Anoia . A report in the Spanish newspaper Lavanguardia , said : ` He looked like a hermit . He was filthy . '
The newspaper reported that Abouyaaqoub was wearing two shirts and trousers which were different from the clothing he was seen wearing immediately after his rampage in Barcelona .
It added : ` He had no backpack , no bag , no phone , no money . ' He was said to be carrying two knives and a razor with two of the blades wrapped in plastic wrap . The newspaper claimed that Abouyaaqoub died with his eyes wide open and ` his face disfigured by the impact of bullets . '
Major Josep Lluis Trapero , the chief of the Catalan Police , said two local police officers had earlier reported seeing a man looking like the suspect while they were in their patrol car in the area .
At around the same time , a local woman called in saying she was certain that she had seen Abouyaaquob running in scrubland around a vineyard close to an Amoco petrol station .
The woman claimed that her suspicions were raised as he was wearing heavy clothing including a long sleeved top on a hot afternoon . Initial reports suggested that Abouyaaquob may have been in a car after the owner of the nearby Caves Ventura Soler vineyard reported seeing a vehicle speeding down his driveway on to a dirt track .
A dramatic video of heavily armed police raiding the homes of the Barcelona terror suspects has been released .
Specialist firearms officers and plain clothed detectives can be seen searching the flats and apartments of the suspects just hours after the Thursday night attacks .
Using torches attached to guns the police sift through documents , empty cupboards and check whether domestic cooking gas bottles have booby-trapped and turned into bombs .
Detectives can be seen searching under mattress and inspecting a wardrobe wearing plastic gloves .
Wearing full-face protection , bullet proof vests and armed with machine guns and pistols squadrons of specialist police can be seen entering building after building as they search for evidence against the Barcelona and Cambrils atrocities .
The officers from the Mossos d'Esquadra police use battering rams to break-down the front door of one apartment block during a dawn raid . And they check air-vents and drainage pipes to make sure no one escapes .
In a statement describing the film said : ` This is how we went into the homes of the terrorists on Thursday night , following the attacks on Barcelona dn Cambrils . '
Nick Fagge in Barcelona
But Maria Ventura , the daughter of the owner , told Mailonline that it had turned out her father had actually seen an unmarked police car racing across her family 's land to investigate the sighting of Abouyaaquob .
Maria , 25 , said : ` My father had seen this car travelling on our land when we were closed . We later checked with the police and they told us that it was a police car with no markings on it . '
Abouyaaquob is thought to have run on to the footpath before being finally cornered by officers , around 30ft from the road about a kilometre from the main Caves Ventura Soler buildings . The spot is around 50metres from a railway line carrying inter-city trains and adjacent to a sewage treatment station .
Major Trapero said the terrorist was asked to stop and identify himself and lifted his shirt to show what appeared to be an explosive belt . Abouyaacoub then yelled , ` Allahu Akbar ' before the officers shot him down . A bomb disposal robot later confirmed his suicide belt was fake .
Police are still investigating whether he may have been receiving help from anyone in the area .
Maria Rosell , the mayor of Sant Sadurni D'Anoia , refused to identify the woman who spotted the terrorist and alerted police . She said : ` This local woman called police at around 4.30 pm to say she had seen the terrorist running near the petrol station .
` She said she was an expert in remembering faces and realised that it was the man who was wanted . The police went to check and they found him here . Local people are frightened and conscious of the situation .

` Police are looking at what brought him to this area and whether he might have had any local help . This has always been a safe and peaceful place . '
Last night Catalan police tweeted a message thanking the woman who contacted police , describing her as ` Citizenship X ' .
The tweet on the force 's official @mossos account said : ` Our gratitude to the citizenship x the decisive collaboration in the operation of #Subirats . You are an important piece to fight terrorism ' .
CCTV footage emerged yesterday of Moroccan national Abouyaaquob walking calmly through the La Boqueria food market shortly after his killing spree in Las Ramblas .
He then crossed Barcelona as a frantic hunt was underway for him and hijacked a white Ford Focus , stabbing the driver Pau Perez to death before putting the 34-year-old electrical engineer 's body in the back seat .
Mr Perez is believed to have been on the phone to his family to reassure them he was okay after the Las Ramblas carnage when he was attacked . Abouyaaqoub later drove through a police roadblock at Sant Just Desvern on the outskirts of Barcelona , as police opened fire later on Thursday .
He abandoned the car nearly two miles away at the side of the road with the body of former aid worker Mr Perez still inside . It is not known if he then headed off on foot or found another vehicle .
One suggestion is that he might have headed to the wine-producing region in a bid to fit in as many Moroccans work in vineyards in the area .
Pere Pons , the mayor of Subirats , today posted an official notice on his council 's website praising the ` effort and professionalism ' of police in hunting down Abouyaaqoub . He said that officers had risked their lives to ` defend the democratic aspects of Catalan society ` .










The death of Abouyaacoub on Monday evening brings to an end the worst terror attack on Spanish soil in 13 years , as police say all 12 member of the cell which carried it out are either dead or arrested .

Police said detention warrants had been issued for Nuzman and his associate , Arthur Cesar de Menezes Soares Filho .
Nuzman left his house accompanied by his lawyer and later appeared at a police station for questioning . At his house , police were seen removing suitcases , documents and a computer .
Nuzman 's lawyer , Sergio Mazzillo , told reporters outside the house that his client would cooperate but was innocent of any wrongdoing .
' I can confirm that -LRB- Nuzman -RRB- did not commit any irregularity , ' Mazzillo said . ` Unfortunately , this has created a media spectacle . '
A police statement said authorities were investigating an international corruption scheme that involved the buying of International Olympic Committee votes for the awarding of the 2016 Games . In total , 11 detention warrants were issued for people in both Brazil and France in what police dubbed ` Operation Unfair Play . '
The IOC said it had ` learned about these circumstances from the media and is making every effort to get the full information . '
The 75-year-old Nuzman was an IOC member for 12 years and one of the most prominent players in bringing the games to Rio . He is now an honorary IOC member and part of the 2020 Tokyo Games commission , which advises organizers how to run the event .
Soon after the Rio Games , IOC President Thomas Bach awarded Nuzman the ` Olympic Order , ' given to those who have made extraordinary contributions to the Olympic movement .
French and Brazilian authorities have been working on a corruption investigation involving bribery surrounding the awarding of the 2016 Rio Games and the 2020 Tokyo Games .
In France , a two-year-old probe into corruption in sports first came to light with the arrest in November 2015 of Lamine Diack , the former head of the IAAF . The French have been looking into allegations that Diack , one of his sons , Papa Massata Diack , and others were involved in blackmailing athletes and covering-up doping positives .
That initial and ongoing probe has now morphed into several investigations , expanded beyond the IAAF to look at suspicions of possible vote-buying in the awarding of sports events , and involved law enforcement agencies beyond France .
Since the Rio Games ended last August , there has been a steady stream of corruption allegations surrounding the awarding of building projects .
Former Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes is being investigated for allegedly accepting at least 15 million Brazilian Reais -LRB- # 3.6 million -RRB- in payments to facilitate construction projects tied to the games .
Paes , who has denied wrongdoing , is one of dozens of top politicians implicated in a sweeping judicial corruption investigation into allegations that construction giant Odebrecht illegally paid billions to help win contracts .",Police searched the house of the president of the Brazilian Olympic committee
28,99cc78ba4a9754072f4a45bf791b1e35e10bdf32,"A college administrator has been charged following a hit and run accident that injured an inexperienced cyclist .
Tyler Noe and friend Greg Goodman were riding on a popular recreational route in central Tennessee when a Volvo , said to be driven by Marshall Grant Neely III , smashed into Noe .
Dramatic helmet-camera footage from Goodman , 48 , captured the moment of impact between Noe and the SUV driven by Neely , an employee at the University School of Nashville .
Last Saturday Neely was arrested and charged with three misdemeanors and one felony .
Charges include a felony of reckless endangerment , leaving the scene of an accident , failure to immediately notify of an accident and failure to render aid .
Authorities identified Neely as the driver of a black Volvo that struck cyclist Tyler Noe of Nolensville on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Williamson County .
In an interview with the Tennessean Neely claimed that he did n't know he hit a cyclist and would have stopped had he had known .
Neely said : ' I did not see the man . There were bicyclist all other the place . I thought somebody had thrown his bike at me .
` The police came and they asked me what happened and I said '' I do n't know . There was a guy there and I remember he was standing there . ''
' I said maybe he threw his bike at me . Obviously the video shows otherwise . '
Despite the horrific collision Noe , 23 , got to his feet moments after he was felled and brushed himself down .
The footage also shows Neely , 58 , speeding off from the scene as Noe hits the ground .
Goodman , who is also from Nolensville , shared the footage with investigators . It helped authorities , including U.S. Park Rangers and Williamson County Sheriff 's deputies make the arrest .

Goodman , who says he was taking Noe one of his first bike rides as an adult , knew they were allowed to ride in the lane on the Natchez Trace Parkway .
Noe escaped from the incident without any serious injuries with Goodman admitting that he looks ` he looks awful , but he is going to be OK . '

Robert Branney , 71 , who was in the police force for 28 years , was caught last year on internet chatrooms with other paedophiles .
He was given an eight-month suspended sentence in May 2016 for possessing indecent images of children on his laptop - but today was sentenced at Truro Crown Court , Cornwall , to 14 months behind bars after being found with 258 more indecent images and therefore breaching the terms of his first sentence .
The latest images are of children as young as five and some were in the most severe category , such as ones of children being raped .
Branney from St Austell , Cornwall , pleaded guilty to one charge of making indecent images of a child .
Ramsay Quaife , prosecuting , told the court that the offences took place after Branney was arrested for last year 's charges .
` The offence came to light when police noticed a Category C image was uploaded to a website in July last year , ' he said .
` Officers investigated the username which identified the home address .
` The paedophile online investigation then launched a search of the address on December 9 last year . '
Two devices were then seized which were found to contain 25 still Category A images and one film , 36 Category B stills and 197 Category C stills .
Officers also discovered file-sharing software and specific child porn internet searches .
Defending Branney , Chris Spencer said he ` deeply regrets the situation ' and his wife and family had been deeply affected by the hostility shown towards them following the crimes , particularly evident on social media .
` His wife has left the home they shared and community they 've been a part of for many years , ' said Mr Spencer .
` He 's at a loss to explain how he has fallen to this point and we can only speculate the impact of experiences during his service have had on his moral reasoning . '
Sentencing , Judge Simon Carr said : ` On May 12 of last year this court passed a suspended sentence for almost identical offences but you clearly manipulated and misled all those trying to help you .
` Throughout the whole court process you were committing more offences and continued to do so after the sentence was imposed .
` You were turning up to various events designed to address your problems convincing those there that you were engaging . The images seized included images of the highest category showing the forced rape of children . '","Robert Branney from St Austell , Cornwall , served police for 28 years"

Sin 's City 's iconic strip was turned into a sea of green as supporters from the Emerald Isle donned flashy outfits , sang songs and proudly waved flags in support of their countryman .
UFC fighter McGregor , from Dublin , is transitioning into boxing for the first time to fight Mayweather .
The money-spinning showdown is likely to break all records and surpass the $ 600million -LRB- # 468million -RRB- generated by Mayweather 's 2015 fight with Manny Pacquiao .
Scroll down for video
An audience packed with 20,000 ravenous fans is expected at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas , USA , with private jets ferrying celebrities into Vegas as bets worth more than a million dollars are placed on the bout .
And the party has already begun on the streets outside where passionate fans have displayed their support .
One group of topless revellers were pictured brandishing a Republic of Ireland flag emblazoned with the words : ` F *** the Mayweather ' .
And one man in his nation 's football shirt looked particularly pleased as he posed for a snap with two scantilly-clad showgirls .
Mayweather , who has an incredible undefeated record of 49-0 to his name , has come out of retirement to fight the younger McGregor .
And while the line-up in the ring has had people talking for months , it is the Corona ring girls - Tawny Jordan , Kyra Keli , Samantha Kumiko and Jessica Harbour - who very well could steal the limelight from the two men in gloves .

Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor 's bout has garnered such interest that it is set to smash all previous betting records .
As the biggest market of all time , the punters are flocking to make a quick buck , with most opting for the underdog .
McGregor 's odds have shortened dramatically , but where can the best value be found ahead of Saturday 's clash ?
Outright betting
The most popular market , particularly for casual gamblers is simply , who they are backing to have their hand raised at the end .
SkyBet have the best odds on Mayweather to bring it home -LRB- 1/4 -RRB- and also offer the best value for his opponent to shock the world -LRB- 7/2 -RRB- .
One bettor staked # 650,000 on a McGregor victory at 10/3 -- which would return winnings of more than # 2.8 million . And Paddy Power estimate they would lose # 10million if the ` Notorious ' earns the belt .
Most popular method of winning
Both men have predicted a KO of their opponent , with McGregor foreseeing his victory inside four rounds .
His opponent simply promised a knockout so one of them , and plenty of gamblers will be wrong .
Mayweather by KO/TKO -LRB- 8/11 , BetFred -RRB- and decision -LRB- 11/4 , Coral -RRB- come out on top value .
Daily Mail 's tips for the fight -LRB- All Paddy Power -RRB-
Many believe the Irishman to have a power advantage , citing his opponent 's age , brittle hands , and recent track record of going the distance .
But Mayweather is coming up against vastly experienced boxers , not a man in his first professional bout , with that said , it may be worth getting on the 49-0 star to win by KO in the first three rounds -LRB- 11/2 -RRB-
If the veteran does n't have the ability to inflict enough damage by the time 12 rounds are up , he is surely going to have outboxed McGregor so a decision win -LRB- 11/4 -RRB- could be well worth a dabble .
The ` Notorious ' signed a strict contract , forbidding him to land any MMA style strikes outlawed under the Queensbury Rules . And yet the aggressive Irishman could be disqualified in a number of other ways if he becomes frustrated , it might be a risk worth taking for punters -LRB- 13/2 -RRB- .
If the most-hyped contest of the year manages to live up to expectations with a dramatic climax , Mayweather could tire the 28-year-old down by the later rounds so a stoppage between rounds 10-12 -LRB- 13/2 -RRB- might be a solid option .

McGregor to be disqualified for throwing a kick -LRB- 12/1 -RRB-
Both fighters to be knocked-out simultaneously -LRB- 250/1 -RRB-
McGregor to not land a punch -LRB- 50/1 -RRB-



Last night the pair faced off for the final time before they meet in the ring , with both men making appearances at the official weigh-in .
After stripping down to his boxer briefs for the weigh-in , ` Mystic Mac ' , as McGregor is known , left little to the imagination as he faced off with the undefeated boxing legend known as Money .
Muscles were not the only thing bulging during the spectacular stare-down , with veins visibly popping in McGregor 's neck as he screamed in the face of his more composed opponent .
Mayweather wore a special pair of underwear himself - an Irish-green pair branded with PaddyPower and the catchphrase ` Always bet on black ' .
The outrageous display sparked a storm of shocked comments on social media , with some users saying they understood the Irishman 's willingness to walk around in his underwear .
` McGregor was a little excited during this weigh in , ' said one Twitter user . ` McGregor has got a banana in his pants loool how excited is he ?! ' wrote another .
` Now I get why McGregor left his pants off after the weigh-in #heproud ' was another fan 's reaction .
McGregor spectacularly defied Floyd Mayweather 's prediction that he would fail to make the weight as they came to the scales before their mega-millions extravaganza .
The Notorious weighed in a full pound under the 154lbs weight limit . Mayweather was significantly but expectedly lighter at 149 1/2 lbs .
That put paid to the notion that his training may have been compromised by late , nightly visits to his strip club . McGregor returned to screaming at Mayweather come the stare down .
` He looks like dog s *** , ' said McGregor of his opponent . ` You know that . He looks blown out . Full of water . He 's not going to keep my pace . Trust me on that . That 's the worst shape I 've ever seen him . '
Amir Khan 's estranged wife has praised Conor McGregor for his devotion to his long-term partner in a sly dig at her own husband .
Faryal Makhdoom Khan posted a tweet that included a quote from the mixed martial arts superstar explaining how he 'd been with his girlfriend Dee Devlin for eight years when they used to live on unemployment benefits .
Above the quote , Faryal wrote : ` Love this . I really respect men who respect their women despite how famous they get . '
It comes weeks after an astonishing public spat between Faryal and Khan when the boxer announced his marriage split on Twitter and both accused the other of cheating .
Khan also accused his American wife of having an affair with heavyweight rival Anthony Joshua .



` I 'm going to breeze through him , trust me on that . I 'm a professional , I make weight - its sacrifice , dedication , focus , but I make it . I 'm ready .
` I 'm going to be a lot bigger than him tomorrow night , maybe closer to 170 . '
McGregor received a boisterous Irish welcome as he entered the T-Mobile Arena draped in his country 's flag and sporting glasses hinged with sun lenses .
Mayweather responded to his mixed reception by pointing to his white ` The Best Ever ' baseball cap and T-shirt , smiling broadly and then warning fans of the Irishman : ` This will be Conor McGregor 's last fight also . '
Mayweather brushed off any potential advantage for McGregor over the size difference though after ending his two-year retirement .
` Weight does n't win fights . Fighting wins fights , ' said the American .
A sizeable Irish contingent has travelled to Vegas to cheer the 29-year-old in action and he repeatedly saluted his supporters .
` You ca n't beat us , we 've already taken over what we want , ' said McGregor . ` Las Vegas is Ireland now . '

Floyd Mayweather fights Conor McGregor in the Irishman 's professional boxing debut at Las Vegas ' T-Mobile Arena on Saturday .
McGregor and Mayweather will fight under boxing rules , giving the ` Money Man ' a clear advantage .
That obviously means the Irishman will not be allowed to kick , elbow or use any of his usual take-down moves .
Boxing etiquette requires the pair to touch gloves before the first and last round -- but those gloves will be smaller than their normal size , weighing just eight-ounces instead of ten , to increase McGregor 's advantage . He normally fights with four-ounce gloves that are fingerless with very little padding .
Other than that the normal rules apply : Three judges will decide the points each three-minute round . The winner of the round is given 10 points and the loser takes nine .
However , a boxer loses a point if they are ` floored ' .
The fight could , however , be ended swiftly with a knockout if the opponent ca n't get up after 10 seconds of falling to the ground .
Here are the significant differences between boxing and the Ultimate Fighting Championship :
LENGTH AND NUMBER OF ROUNDS
A high-level boxing match is almost always scheduled for 12 three-minute rounds . When a boxer makes his professional debut , they are often scheduled for four three-minute rounds , which is usually gradually increased to six , eight , 10 and then finally 12 . In women 's boxing , two-minute rounds are largely favoured . Boxing debutant McGregor will fight over 12 .
UFC rules dictate that each non-championship contest is to be scheduled for three five-minute rounds . A championship contest is for five five-minute rounds .
In both sports , there is a rest period of one minute between rounds .
THE NATURE OF THE FIGHT
Boxers are officially only allowed to attack their opponents through punching , and even excessive clenching is discouraged and monitored by the referee . If a boxer is knocked down , his opponent is not allowed to resume attacking him until he has returned to his feet and has the referee 's permission to do so .
In UFC , fighters can box , grapple , wrestle , kick-box , and continue to strike their opponent while they have been knocked down .
SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE RING
A boxing ring , within the rules of the British Boxing Board of Control , should have four ropes and be between 16-20 square feet .
A UFC ` octagon ' must be between a minimum of 20 square feet and a maximum of 32 . It is also surrounded by a fence .
CUTS MEN
Boxers regularly provide their own cuts man , and one of their choosing . The UFC , however , provide one for each corner , and that same cuts man works the same corner for every fight of each event .

SPONSORSHIP
Unlike in boxing , UFC fighters are forbidden by their contracts to pursue their own sponsorship deals . They presently have an overall sponsorship in place with Reebok .
WEIGH-INS
In boxing , a fighter must weigh in at the scheduled time and if he or she is overweight , has an hour to return and achieve the correct weight . If they remain overweight after an hour they do not receive a further chance , though the fight may still proceed .
In the UFC , on the day before a fight , a fighter has a window of four hours in which they can make weight at their own convenience .
GLOVES
A boxing glove covers the entire hand , and in fights between the flyweight and welterweight divisions , 8oz gloves are generally worn .
In the UFC , a fighter 's fingers remain exposed , and the glove generally weighs between 4oz and 6oz .





Mayweather was not phased by the partisan crowd though - even daring to wear Paddy Power green underwear .
The event will be broadcast on Sky Sports Box Office at a cost of # 19.95 in the UK or 24.95 euros for McGregor 's Republic of Ireland compatriots .
Punters across the pond will have to fork out 89.99 US dollars for standard definition and 99.99 US dollars in HD .
It is likely to start around 5am UK time -LRB- 9pm in Vegas -RRB- - but it may even be 5.30 am when the first bell sounds .
He said : ` The fans ca n't fight for him . It comes down to the two competitiors .
` In the 49 times I won out there , it was one on one . '
The two were a stark contrast in their behaviour as they posed head-to-head for the cameras after the weigh-in .
Mayweather was cool , calm and collected as he stared at McGregor , while the Irishman laughed , smiled and launched a verbal assault of trash talk .
It was only when they broke away that Mayweather broke into a smile and laughed at the UFC lightweight champion 's remarks .
But after an undefeated record as a former five-weight world champion , Mayweather stressed how he has been here and done it all before .
` I 've been here before . I know what it takes when it 's a fight of this magnitude , ' said Mayweather .

` I 've done a lot of this -LRB- chatting -RRB- he 's done a lot of this , but tomorrow it comes down to the fighters . '
Conor McGregor is a risk taker . If he 's not dominating his opponent in the cage with his unorthodox approach to fighting , the UFC champion is killin ' it in the style game .
The 29-year-old professional mixed martial artist has a flashy fashion sense that only a brave , confident man can pull off .
In celebration of his highly-anticipated and unprecedented fight tomorrow night with undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather , FEMAIL chats with Conor 's stylist and David August CEO , David Heil .
` Conor 's style is bold , ' said David . ` He loves taking risks and pushing boundaries in both his sport and fashion .
` Everything he does has style so we make sure to provide him with an impeccable wardrobe that is all about color , pattern , prints and most importantly , fit . '
With Conor 's size fluctuating depending on his fight class , David needs to always take that into consideration .
` Conor loves a full complete look , down to the details . Whenever we create a new look for a public appearance , he 's almost always in a 3-piece suit , with coordinating shirt , tie , pocket square , lapel pin and cufflinks to complete the style . '
At this week 's press conference in Las Vegas , Conor wore a custom David August 3-piece dark hunter green and navy plaid suit fabricated in a Super 130s wool from Italy .
The look is complete with a white dress shirt , a navy blue with green and silver stripe tie , coordinating pocket square and lapel pin .
` As a famous personality , we use fashion as a way to engage his fans and show a different side to him outside of the cage/ring , ' shared David .
The fighter may have made his biggest fashion statement at the New York stop of the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor World Press Tour .
` The New York stop was fun for all of us . Because there was intense heat and humidity in the city that day , Conor wanted to do something different . He called me while shopping that afternoon with the idea of wearing our floral pants with the Gucci mink coat with no shirt .
' I actually did n't want him to go shirtless , but when he has a vision in mind , it 's hard to steer him in a different direction . Once again , he looked great and completely owned the look . '
At the tour 's first press conference , Floyd wore a star printed hooded track suit by sportswear brand The Money Team .
Conor made it a point to mock the boxer for his boyish fashion choice , while he wore a supremely tailored custom David August pinstripe suit .
But on closer inspection , the print was n't ordinary run-of-the-mill pinstripes : It was the words `` F**k You '' written over and over again . That 's one way to use fashion as a form of self-expression !
' I think Conor recognizes the importance of dressing for the occasion so he 's always thinking about his image regardless if it 's for public appearances or not , ' said David .
Having worked with him for several years , the stylist knows what he likes and makes all fabric selections and designs well in advance .
` Ultimately when making final fabric choices I not only think of Conor but truly consider his amazing fans who support and love him .
` When working with professional athletes the goal is to help them create their brand through fashion . I really try to create a signature look for each and every client that their fans will come to know and love . '
While what the champion will be wearing on Saturday night is still undecided , David assures that Conor 's look in the ring will make his fans proud . He also shares that the fighter has a few wool 3-piece suit options to choose from for his arrival .
As reported , his opponent Floyd Mayweather , 40 , will wear a custom boxing robe and trunks designed by Phillip Plein .
But according to David , there 's no contest . ' I do n't think there 's even a doubt who will outshine here in winning style . '




A beginners ' guide McGregor , Mayweather and the biggest fight in a generation
Who is Conor McGregor ?
A one-time plumber from Dublin , the man known as The Notorious is Ireland 's biggest sports star . He 's also the biggest name in the Ultimate Fighting Championship -LRB- UFC -RRB- , a mixed-martial arts -LRB- MMA -RRB- promotion . Like Mayweather , he is loud , brash and talented . He is also a pay-per-view hit , his headline bout with Nate Diaz at UFC 202 being the most bought MMA event in history . His MMA record stands at 21 wins and three losses .
What is UFC ?
Boxing has often looked down its nose at UFC , but its competitors are supreme athletes . Fighters use styles from a mixture of disciplines , such as boxing , wrestling , Muay Thai , Brazilian ju-jitsu , judo and karate . Bouts take place in an eight-sided cage known as ` The Octagon ' .
So is McGregor allowed to kick Mayweather ?
Absolutely not . This is strictly a boxing match . Any attempt by McGregor to kick , wrestle , elbow or use holds should result in disqualification .
Does he know how to box ?
Yes . He was training at the Crumlin Boxing club in Dublin as a 12-year-old and became All-Ireland champion at youth level before turning his attention to other combat sports at 16 .
Why is Mayweather taking the fight ?
Money , and lots of it . How much he makes depends on PPV sales . It could be as much as $ 230m but that figure will be boosted by other revenues . Mayweather 's sponsored fight attire will add another $ 20m to his earnings . McGregor could pocket $ 70m . The split between the pair is confidential , though reports suggest it is roughly 70-30 in Mayweather 's favour .
World titles on the line ?
No , but a special ` Money ' belt has been commissioned for the fight . It has no sporting value but contains 3,360 diamonds , 600 saphires , 160 emeralds and roughly 3.3 lbs of 24-carat gold .
Does McGregor have any chance ?
It 's boxing , so he always has a puncher 's chance . The Irishman , 11 years younger , certainly has power , especially in his left hand . Both his UFC titles were won via stoppage and he has a knockout percentage of 86 . But will he ever get close enough to Floyd to unleash his power ? It 's unlikely given Mayweather has rarely been shaken in his career .
Is Mayweather over the hill at 40 ?
Not at all . The American is a consummate professional and always keeps himself within a few pounds of his fighting weight . He has n't fought since 2015 but do n't expect his lightning-quick reactions to be greatly diminished . His diet and preparations will have been on point . After all , this is big business for him .
Anthony Joshua : ` It 's probably going to be a landslide . Mayweather 's made great fighters look average . Conor ca n't really compete . He 's going into Mayweather 's domain . It 's going to be a really big challenge . ' - MAYWEATHER
Lennox Lewis : ` There is tremendous hype but I do n't really take it as a serious fight . No one 's figured out how to beat Mayweather in 49 fights - and now a UFC fighter is trying to beat him . I think it 's a farce . ' - MAYWEATHER
Chris Eubank : ` Everybody is forgetting that McGregor is an Irishman . It is not about ability , it is about spirit . You ca n't match an Irishman 's spirit . ' - MCGREGOR
Manny Pacquiao : ` McGregor has absolutely no chance ! There is no way he 'll be able to even land a punch on Mayweather . How could he when he has no experience in boxing ? ' - MAYWEATHER
How will the fight play out ?
Mayweather is arguably the greatest defensive fighter of all time . He is also a supreme risk assessor . He has opened up against lesser fighters but he has exercised greater caution against big punchers , such as Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Alvarez . Of course , one punch can end a fight but it is difficult to make a case for McGregor against one of the greatest boxers ever .
Mayweather has never been interested in entertaining , nor does he take unnecessary risks to go for a knockout . Therefore he may be cagey in the first couple of rounds and gradually pick off McGregor . Whether the Irishman is knocked out depends on his endurance . A knockout for Mayweather is the most likely outcome but do n't be surprised if the American wins on points by a landslide .
How can I watch it ?
Mayweather and McGregor will begin their ring walks at approximately 5am on Sunday morning -LRB- UK time -RRB- on Sky Sports Box Office .
Who is the referee ?
American Robert Byrd who has refereed one other Mayweather fight , a unanimous victory over Robert Guerrero in May 2013 . The judges are Dave Moretti -LRB- US -RRB- , Burt Clements -LRB- US -RRB- and Guido Cavalleri -LRB- Italy -RRB- .
What else do I need to know ?
The Nevada State Athletic Commission sprung a shock by allowing the fighters to wear 8oz rather than 10oz gloves . Both will be happy with the change . For McGregor , the gloves are closer to the 4oz ones he wears in UFC , increasing his chances of landing a knockout blow . For Mayweather , wearing gloves that are 2oz lighter should increase his renowned hand speed .
Who 's on the undercard ?
Given that the main event has the potential to be a damp squib , the undercard has been wisely stacked with some good fights -- and there 's plenty of British interest . Wales ' Nathan Cleverly defends his light-heavyweight world title against Sweden 's Badou Jack , who defeated George Groves and also held James DeGale to draw .
Hartlepool-born Savannah Marshall , Britain 's first women 's amateur world champion , makes her professional debut , against American Sydney LeBlanc .
Mayweather 's protege Gervonta Davis will still fight despite being stripped of his IBF super-featherweight world title after failing to make the weight . He takes on Francisco Fonseca , but the title is only on the line for the Costa Rican should he pull off an upset .
How do the bookies see it ?
Mayweather is favourite , though still a generous 3/10 * , a bigger price than in many of his regular fights . McGregor is a stingy 5/2 * .

` No one knows what 's coming and that 's why there is a lot of fear around in the boxing community and in his camp . They do n't know what to expect . '
Conor McGregor is right , of course . No one , not least Floyd Mayweather , knows what quite what he will produce on his boxing debut on August 26 . He is not used to wearing boots , nor wearing boxing trunks . He has never before fought with 10oz gloves or had to wear a boxer 's groin protector .
These changes may seem trivial , but top level sport is about fine margins and McGregor will need to make innumerable important adjustments to stand a chance against Mayweather . Here , MailOnline details five crucial differences between the sports that he must master :
Learn to last a 12-round fight
Conor McGregor is in tremendous shape , the best condition that his trainer John Kavanagh has seen him in . The MMA star is midway through a gruelling training camp for the Las Vegas showdown on August 26 as he looks to upset the undefeated American .
But all the strength and conditioning work McGregor has done until now in his career has been geared towards three or five , five-minute rounds . Now , he faces the prospect of 12 , three-minute sessions in the squared-circle .
The Irishman claims boxing is ` easy ' because ` no one is kicking me , no one is elbowing me , no one is trying to choke me ' . But no one has ever tried to punch him for 36 minutes , either . To try and build up his conditioning , John Kavanagh revealed McGregor would do four times as much sparring as he would for an MMA fight .
Mayweather , by contrast , has won 26 world title fights over 12 rounds in his illustrious ring career . The 40-year-old has only registered two knockouts in the past 11 years and has made a habit of negating opponents ' threats on the way to a comfortable points victory .
Familiarise himself with the squared-circle
Floyd Mayweather has been in a boxing ring since he could barely walk and few fighters are as intelligent in their movement as ` Money ' . The unbeaten American is a master at using all four corners to keep out of range and control the pace of fights .
McGregor , meanwhile , has spent his career the Octagon . Sparring sessions with the likes of Paulie Malignaggi will help him familiarise himself with the movements of fighters within the squared-circle . But even at 40 , Mayweather will likely prove far more elusive than anyone McGregor has shared the ring with .

Floyd Mayweather is one of the finest defensive fighters in boxing history . Before calling himself ` Money ' , he was given the nickname ` Pretty Boy ' by after making a habit of finishing fights with barely a scratch .
One of the secrets to his success is his superb control of distance . He has made a career of staying just out of range , making opponent 's miss and punishing them with quick counters before removing himself from the danger zone .
If he has any hope of landing his dynamite left hand , the Irishman will need to find a way to cut the ring off - a skill many multi-weight world champions have failed to do effectively enough against ` Money ' .
Mayweather has also proven over time that he is far from a sitting duck on the rare occasions he is pinned to the ropes . The 40-year-old is more than comfortable using his surroundings to fire off quick counters or slip out of danger .
Control the distance
Floyd Mayweather is one of the finest defensive fighters in boxing history . Before calling himself ` Money ' , he was given the nickname ` Pretty Boy ' by after making a habit of finishing fights with barely a scratch .
One of the secrets to his success is his superb control of distance . He has made a career of staying just out of range , making opponent 's miss and punishing them with quick counters before removing himself from the danger zone .
McGregor is also a fine counter-puncher in the Octagon . But , with shots coming from both hands and feet in MMA , the Irishman tends to sit well on his backfoot , far further from his opponent than is common in boxing .
Some analysts feel this could actually play into McGregor 's hands . And it 's true that Mayweather will have never faced someone fighting out of an MMA stance . But neither will McGregor have fought someone so adept at fighting at closer range . Will he be able to deal with it ?
Master the tricks of the trade
Besides the obvious need to curb his instinct to kick and elbow Mayweather , McGregor faces a race against time to learn boxing 's dark arts .
` Money ' is famed for having his razor sharp hands and reactions . But 21 years as professional , including more than a decade spent as world champion , have taught him every trick in the book .
Holding , getting shots off inside , twisting arms , the 40-year-old knows it all . To try and get up to speed , McGregor has called in veteran referee Joe Cortez to officiate his sparring sessions .
The 73-year-old is familiar with Mayweather . He was criticised for his handling of the American 's fight with Ricky Hatton and also took charge of his clash with Victor Ortiz , when ` Money ' used his experience to punish his opponent 's attempt to touch gloves and secure a stoppage .
Adapt his own fighting style
McGregor has risen to the top of UFC thanks to his fine counter-punching . The Irish star is ruthless at punishing opponents when they dive in or make a mistake . Unfortunately for the Irishman , however , Mayweather is not a UFC fighter . He is one of the finest counter-punching boxers of all time .
And between now and fight night McGregor faces a dilemma . Does he stick to his guns and attempt to out-counter the counter-master ? Or he will he look to use his size and power to pressure the unbeaten American . The likes of Ricky Hatton and Marcos Maidana have tried and failed to walk Mayweather down , while he has beaten bigger men such as Oscar De La Hoya .
Having predicted an early knockout , the onus is arguably on McGregor to be the aggressor . But that 's not his style . Mayweather , too , is more than happy to eek out an uneventful victory . Do n't expect his style to change . It 's over to you , Conor .





The real Conor McGregor ... A former plumber who cried in defeat and has gone from $ 188-a-week dole to # 62m fight in four years
The pawnbroker who made Conor McGregor cry is dredging up an old transaction . He wrestles with his memory but ca n't quite get a choke hold on the figures .
` They paid me $ 400 , ' Artemij Sitenkov tells Sportsmail . ` Or it might have been 500 . It was a long time ago . At the time , I did n't think anyone would care about it now , nine years on . '
With that , the 34-year-old laughs down the phone from his home in Lithuania . He 's happy enough , this jack of all trades who manages gyms , trades antiques and runs a pawn shop .

He also does mixed martial arts when he needs extra cash , balancing 16 defeats with 15 wins from Kazakhstan to Ireland , where he rocked up in June 2008 to a hall in Drimnagh , Dublin .
It was McGregor 's third professional MMA fight and his first defeat , with the former plumber tapping out after 69 seconds .
` He was crying after and was being comforted by his trainer , ' Sitenkov says . ' I went home and did n't think of him again . Then , a few years later , wow . UFC , fame , everything . This thing with Floyd Mayweather , wow . '


It 's the anomaly that looks like a mismatch at best and a freak show at worst . But how has a non-boxer , who was drawing dole cheques in 2013 , talked and grappled his way to a payday worth in excess of # 60million ?
Not much of it makes sense . Except , that is , to those in Dublin who know McGregor best and who know about the self-help book , the gorilla video and the women 's skincare products . To them , their mad friend has had this date from the start .

Phil Sutcliffe is grinning in his recollections . He runs the Crumlin Boxing Club , a mile from where McGregor grew up .
It is not the grenade-ravaged hell of a recent ESPN profile but it does get tasty , and for McGregor that meant being hassled by a group of six lads one day in 1999 , when he was 11 .
The tale goes that he did an Ali shuffle before throwing a left hook and he took a pasting in return . That soon led him to the boxing gym .
` He had been playing football , ' says Sutcliffe . ` He had his muddy boots on and walked straight over our clean floor to hit a bag . We told him to get out .
` He was back a few days later in kit and that was him started . '
Floyd Mayweather claims he has been fed information about Conor McGregor 's preparations in the lead up to their fight .
` Money ' says boxer Paulie Malignaggi is a ` friend ' of his and visited Conor 's camp under his instruction .
Malignaggi had a short lived spell in the McGregor camp as a sparring partner .
But he quit the role after a clip posted online seemingly showed McGregor knocking Malignaggi to the floor .
Malignaggi insists he slipped over , which led to a bitter public dispute .
In a new interview featuring Mayweather and Malignaggi , Money said : ` Paulie has always been my friend .
` My friend called me and said `` Floyd , do you want me to go to camp ? '' I said absolutely .
` We are going to talk about strategy , we 're going to talk about everything . Thank you -LSB- Paulie -RSB- for going over there like I asked . '

In the home of Mags , his mother , and his father Tony , a taxi driver for 26 years , is a trophy of a boxer with its left hand snapped off .
The son peaked as Irish Under 16 schoolboy champion and it is interesting to consider what path his career might have taken if the family had not dragged McGregor screaming to the calmer suburb of Lucan when he was 16 .

He continued to blag lifts back to his club for a while , but , significantly , kick-boxing became a rival fascination and then there were also the conversations with Tom Egan at his new school .
They had seen the Ultimate Fighter cable show and got hooked on a combat with fewer limits . Eventually it came at the expense of boxing .
` Conor and me were training at Crumlin the same time -- he was a very good boxer , ' says Jamie Kavanagh , a 20-1-1 pro . ` We 're still friends and who knows what he might have gone on to in it .
` He was n't as much into the technical side , but his eyes lit up in a fight .
` He did n't get in many street fights compared to some -- I can only remember one when we were away with the club in Malaga . Some guys started and we did n't lose , put it that way .
` The thing with Conor , he has always had great focus . He really could have boxed to a top level but with the intensity this guy has , you would n't have bet against him at any sport . '
McGregor first walked into John Kavanagh 's Straight Blast Gym for MMA in 2006 .
It was a year when two other important things happened -- he left school at 17 to be a plumber and Rhonda Byrne 's book , The Secret , came out , espousing the power of positive thinking .
Upon reading it , McGregor entered Kavanagh 's gym determined to make an impression and famously clattered Owen Roddy , the top dog , in sparring .
Then he was put in with Aisling Daly , a female star of UFC , and floored her with an excessively hard body shot . At that point , Kavanagh joined McGregor on the mat and battered him .
` It is not the done thing to beat up on people in the gym and John was making a point , ' Daly says .
McGregor trained alongside his work as an apprentice plumber , which saw him leave home at 5am each morning . He hated it and quit after 18 months , going on the dole for $ 188 a week , all eyes on MMA . But even then it was far from straightforward .

Gradually , the wins mounted up until he became a two-weight world champion in the Cage Warriors branch of MMA . But while the rapidly-growing UFC is familiar to millions , Cage Warriors and McGregor were invisible .
` Funny thing is , his personality then , when he had nothing , was the same as now , ' Daly says .
` At the gym , I had a female changing room and every day he 'd swagger out in a tiny towel , his hair smelling like my nice shampoo and wearing my moisturisers . He always had loads of charisma , and if you have charisma and can fight , you are on to something . Look at Ali . '
By 2013 , McGregor was still broke . He was a good fighter and talker but was stranded on a tiny platform .
` No one doubted what he would do with the right break , ' Daly says .
And then he got it -- a call to appear on a UFC card in Stockholm . Before he flew , he stopped to collect his $ 188 dole cheque .
Four years on , McGregor is a two-weight UFC world champion , has a speedboat called 188 and owns a # 2m property with his long-time girlfriend . His 2016 earnings of # 26m were ranked by Forbes alongside Gareth Bale 's .
How ? Because the UFC love bombast and violence in ways the rest of society often dislikes and no one does either quite like McGregor , the snarling face of a snarling brand . His gym mates tell tales of unseen humility -- he calls a 13-year-old kick-boxer Nate Kelly ` Nate the great ' and gives him pointers .
But it is the face he presents to the public that has made this fight . It remains to be seen if it all ends in tears again , though the sense around Crumlin is that their man has already won .
Boxing legend Oscar De La Hoya aimed a four letter blast at Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor just hours before their # 540million megafight .
The former six-weight world champion and promoter had branded the Las Vegas showdown on Saturday a ` farce that could irreparably stain boxing ' .
And De La Hoya could not hide his disgust on Friday as he tweeted : F *** YOU #MayweatherVsMcGregor BOTH OF YOU ARE DISRESPECTING THE SPORT OF BOXING #CaneloGGG Sept 16th
The head of Golden Boy Promotions concluded his message by promoting the Sept. 16 bout between Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin .
De La Hoya feels the showdown could have a detrimental effect on one of his events as it comes comes just three weeks the highly-anticipated middleweight title showdown between champion Golovkin and Alvarez in Las Vegas .
He had posted an open letter on Facebook : ` To my fellow #boxing fans : I write in the hopes that together we can protect the sport of boxing .
` With each passing day , it looks more and more likely that the circus known as Floyd Mayweather Vs. Conor McGregor will be coming to town in the near future .
` As undercard fights start to take form , athletic commissions give their blessings in exchange for millions of dollars and the fighters start counting even more cash , one group will eventually be left to make sure this farce does n't occur .
` We , the fans , who are the lifeblood of our sport . '
UFC president Dana White replied to the tweet via his own Instagram account , writing : ` WTF ?!? Is this guy snorting coke and drinking booze again ??!? '

Even at 6am and with sleep patterns hampered by jet lag , the jokes flow amid a sense of excitement at delving a little further into McGregor 's attempt to buck the Vegas odds against Mayweather .
But filming just after dawn to overcome the eight-hour time difference with the UK is one of the more minor issues when it comes to the logistics of broadcasting what is on track to be the biggest-grossing bout in history .
Sky Sports invited Sportsmail along to Thursday morning 's broadcast , to get an insight into what it takes to televise this weekend 's Sky Box Office production .
It 's the biggest Vegas show from Sky since Mayweather 's 2015 encounter against Manny Pacquiao , with a 20-strong production crew flown out to Nevada last week . Another 20 staff have been hired locally to boost their ranks .
Camera and lightning equipment is also rented on location , rather than being squeezed into the bowels of an aeroplane . A tiny 4G transmitter sends the footage straight back to Sky 's UK headquarters .
For the fight itself , extra equipment arrived in trucks at the state-of-the-art T-Mobile Arena on Thursday afternoon . Sky will use the pictures from American broadcaster Showtime , but will also provide footage from four cameras of their own .
Viewers back in the UK wo n't miss a trick .
The biggest challenge posed by this mammoth production , however , has been putting all of this in place in such a short space of time . Sky only received the rights to show the fight at the end of July . It prompted a breakneck dash to organise commentary positions , travel , accommodation and filming locations .
` I 've got wonderful people around me in the team , they 're a fantastic unit and it 's really 24-7 stuff , ' says Smith .
` It is tiring on the body , it 's non-stop , but that 's how we roll , it 's what we do and hopefully we 're providing entertainment for the fans because we 're certainly enjoying it . '
Smith has become the voice and soundtrack to British boxing during his 23 years at Sky . But even after commentating on huge bouts involving the likes of Ricky Hatton , ` Prince ' Naseem Hamed and Anthony Joshua , he realises this weekend 's clash is just a little bit different .
` This is a one-off , incredible attraction that no-one thought was possible , ' he said .
` It 's brought the worlds of boxing and UFC together as one . I 've really enjoyed having -LRB- ex-MMA fighter -RRB- Dan Hardy as part of our team this week to learn more about their sport , their code and how they go about their business .
` It 's showbiz . Vegas entertains and this is what people want . '",Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor meet in a money-spinning Las Vegas showdown on Saturday night

The incident took place at the Vat Ketanak Khmer Temple in Rossmore , in Sydney 's south-west on October 29 , 2014 .
Then 29-year-old Kim reportedly shot Lam once in the head piercing his brain , before turning the weapon on himself .
Both suffered serious wounds to their heads in the altercation , which left them each in a coma .
It came after Kim had been upset and angry when his Australian visa was denied , the New South Wales District Court heard .

Kim had reportedly visited Lam 's wife in the lead-up to the attack , with the District Court judge stating he had made threats to murder .
During the trial the defence argued Kim was mentally ill , however the judge disagreed and said there was ` intent to kill ' .
Following the incident , a member of the congregation told Nine News Mr Lam had allegedly heard a ` bang , bang ' sound before he was shot .
Vannara Kim said Mr Lam was doing paperwork when the shot was fired , with the nail lodging behind the temple president 's right ear .
` He said to me , first of all he heard ` bang bang ' like the nail gun , ' he said after visiting the leader at the hospital .
` After that the monk grabbed his head and shoot him . That 's what he tell me and that 's what I heard from the man . '

The TV and film-themed event , in Salford , Greater Manchester , saw pets don their best fancy dress for the afternoon .
It featured a red carpet and even a VIP area fore very important pugs where owners sipped on prosecco while their dogs tucked into treats .
Some 2,000 people were expected to attend PugFest with dog-less pooch fans also invited to enjoy the food and entertainment on offer .
Visitors were also invited to enter their pets into the Grand Pug Show to show off their hounds ' abilities on an assault course .
PugFest was set up by Martin Clowes as a tribute to Poppy - a late rescue dog which was owned by his son , Rob .
Poppy had a fanbase of nearly 18,000 on her Twitter page @Poppy_puggy and the event supports local and national dog charities .
Rob Clowes told the Manchester Evening News : ` The event also features a kissing booth - where pug lovers can go and see a pug for a pug kiss or for other pugs to have a kiss too .

The defeat , after a troubled summer , was a worrying echo of the manner in which Jose Mourinho 's champions collapsed two seasons ago , costing the ` Special One ' his job -- and on Saturday night bookmakers installed Conte as the favourite to be the first Premier League manager to leave his club this season .
Conte , who only two weeks ago admitted he feared the sack , would not publicly criticise his players or referee Craig Pawson , who sent off Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas .
Conte also denied his unlikely team selection was a message to Roman Abramovich , with rookie Jeremie Boga making his debut ahead of # 70m striker Alvaro Morata .
Asked if playing youngsters such as Boga ahead of Morata was a message that he needs a bigger squad , he responded angrily : ` You do n't know me very well . In pre-season , in every friendly game I played the best formation and it happened also today .
' I do n't have this appetite to send someone a message . Why do I have to send a message ? I want to win , not send a message to my club . '
But the unhappiness Conte showed in pre-season continued as his side imploded , starting when Cahill got a red for going in studs up on Steven Defour .
` It was a key moment , because after this red card we lost our composure and we conceded three goals , ' said Conte .
Two goals from Sam Vokes and a Stephen Ward effort put the Clarets 3-0 up . Substitute Morata scored and David Luiz added a late goal , but Fabregas got a second yellow card and the game was up .",Antonio Conte is favourite to be next Premier League manager to leave his club
35,e957301c03a770076a7414ab0bb488a00743fff6,"Mass evacuations are underway today after Hurricane Irma slammed into the Caribbean with 185mph winds as aid agencies braced for a ` major humanitarian response ' .
America 's National Hurricane Center said Irma had strengthened into a dangerous Category 5 storm as it made its first landfall in islands of northeast Caribbean on a path that could take it to the United States - causing thousands to start panic buying and preparing to evacuate .
This morning , the eye of the ` potentially catastrophic ' hurricane - estimated to be the size of France - lashed Barbuda just hours after officials warned people to seek protection from Irma 's ` onslaught ' in a statement that closed with : ` May God protect us all . '
Heavy rain and howling winds from the hurricane - measured as the most powerful ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean - also raked Antigua , sending debris flying as people huddled in their homes or government shelters . The French islands Saint-Barthelemy and Saint-Martin have also been hit this morning .
U.S. President Donald Trump declared emergencies in Florida , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands , and authorities in the Bahamas said they would evacuate the residents of six islands at the southern end of the island chain .
Experts say Irma is now so powerful it is registering on devices designed to detect earthquakes . Scientists picked up the background noise of winds causing trees to move and crashing ocean waves on their earthquake-detecting seismometers .
It is expected to become the second powerful storm to thrash the U.S. mainland in as many weeks after devastating Hurricane Harvey . A mandatory evacuation is under way in the Florida Keys .
In addition to Irma , Tropical Storm Jose has now formed behind it in the open Atlantic and is expected to develop into a hurricane . A third tropical storm - Katia - has also formed in the Gulf of Mexico with winds but is expected to stay offshore until Friday morning .

The Red Cross this morning said it is preparing for ' a major humanitarian response ' .
` The forecast as it stands right now is extremely worrying , ' said Walter Cotte , the agency 's Regional Director for the Americas . ` We are anticipating major impacts on a number of islands , and we are preparing to respond to needs that may arise . We are especially worried that Irma could affect areas that have been suffering with severe rainfall in the past months .
Leeward Islands : Late Tuesday to Wednesday . Tropical storm-force winds start later Tuesday
Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands : Wednesday to early Thursday
Dominican Republic/Haiti : Thursday to early Friday
Turks and Caicos : Late Thursday to Friday
Bahamas : Friday to this weekend
Cuba : Friday to this weekend
Southeast United States : This weekend into early next week , beginning in south Florida on Saturday

` One of the main challenges is going to be logistical , given the isolation of some the islands . We need to ensure a reliable channel for relief efforts in the aftermath of the hurricane . '
Four other storms have had winds that strong in the overall Atlantic region , but they have been in the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Mexico where the usually warmer waters fuel tropical cyclones . Experts say Irma 's strength is a result of unusually warm water for that part of the Atlantic .
The center said there was a growing possibility that the storm 's effects could be felt in Florida later this week and over the weekend , though it was still too early to be sure of its future track : ` Everyone in hurricane-prone areas should ensure that they have their hurricane plan in place . '
So far , a state of emergency has been called in the state and a mandatory evacuation is under way in the Florida Keys . Schools there are also cancelled until further notice .
Governor Rick Scott activated 100 members of the Florida National Guard to be deployed across the state , and 7,000 more National Guard members were to report for duty on Friday when the storm could be approaching .
Pictures showed people rushing to stock up on drinking water , protective wooden boards for their windows and other supplies .
Meanwhile , tourists have had their Caribbean holiday plans thrown into chaos as Hurricane Irma forces airlines to ground or divert flights .
Antigua airport will be closed on Wednesday and San Juan airport , the busiest in Puerto Rico , has cancelled about 40 per cent of its flights in response to the hurricane .
British Airways sent an empty aircraft to the region to bring customers back early - the full flight of 326 passengers touched down in the UK on Tuesday evening .
It also cancelled a flight from the UK heading to Antigua and then on to Tobago .
Pope Francis flew out of Italy today headed for Colombia , with his plane forced to change route because of Irma . The Alitalia aircraft had been expected to fly over the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico , but will instead shift south and cross the islands of Barbados , Grenada and Trinidad , a Vatican official said .
Authorities warned that the storm could dump up to 10 inches of rain , cause landslides and flash floods and generate waves of up to 23 feet .

The plane carrying Pope Francis to Colombia has been forced to change its flight plan to avoid a run-in with monster Hurricane Irma .
` Because of a hurricane , the Holy Father 's flight will take a more southern route and will enter the airspaces of three other countries , ' Barbados , Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago , the Vatican said .
The special Alitalia flight carrying the head of the world 's Roman Catholics to Latin America set off from Rome shortly after 11am and was originally scheduled to arrive at 4.30 pm local time in Bogota .
The Vatican did not say whether the changes to the flight plan would affect the arrival time .
Pope Francis 's trip , his 20th since his papacy began four years ago , will see him plead for a ` stable and lasting ' peace in a divided country just emerging from a 50-year war that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives .
Government officials began evacuations and urged people to finalize all preparations as shelves emptied out across islands including Puerto Rico .
` The decisions that we make in the next couple of hours can make the difference between life and death , ' Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said . ` This is an extremely dangerous storm . '
Residents on the U.S. East Coast were urged to monitor the storm 's progress in case it should turn northward toward Florida , Georgia or the Carolinas .
` This hurricane has the potential to be a major event for the East Coast . It also has the potential to significantly strain FEMA and other governmental resources occurring so quickly on the heels of -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- Harvey , ' Evan Myers , chief operating officer of AccuWeather , said in a statement .

Florida Governor Rick Scott declared the state of emergency for all 67 counties in the state on Monday after some forecasts showed the powerful storm could be headed for the East Coast .
` Hurricane Irma is a major and life-threatening storm and Florida must be prepared . I have continued to be briefed by the Florida Division of Emergency Management on Hurricane Irma and current forecast models have Florida in Irma 's path - potentially impacting millions of Floridians , ' Scott said .
` Today , given these forecasts and the intensity of this storm , I have declared a state of emergency for every county in Florida to make certain that state , federal and local governments are able to work together and make sure resources are dispersed to local communities as we get prepared for this storm . '
He also ordered the suspension of road tolls across the state and activated 100 members of the Florida National Guard to prepare for Hurricane Irma .
Richard Branson is refusing to leave his 74-acre Necker Island complex in the British Virgin Islands despite the ` extremely dangerous ' Hurricane Irma crashing into the Caribbean .
The Miami-based National Hurricane Center reported that the storm , which is expected to make landfall along the string of French islands that includes Guadeloupe later today before heading to Haiti and Florida , has now become the maximum Category 5 .

This morning , the eye of the ` potentially catastrophic ' hurricane hit Barbuda just hours after officials warned people to seek protection from Irma 's ` onslaught ' in a statement that closed with : ` May God protect us all . '
But Branson , writing on his blog yesterday , said he is not going to leave his island to dodge the storm .
The monster hurricane , the most powerful on the five-level Saffir-Simpson scale , is about 270 miles east of the island of Antigua and is packing maximum sustained winds of 175 miles per hour .
The storm was moving towards the west at 14 miles per hour , and is expected to drop between four and eight inches of rain when it hits land .
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich 's $ 50million pad on St Barts is also in the hurricane 's path .
British Airways has already cancelled a flight from Gatwick to Antigua in light of the warnings .
` These rainfall amounts may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides , ' the NHC warned .
The storm is also is expected to 'cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions . '
Branson fully acknowledged the danger of Hurricane Irma , stressing that the ` devastation ' they can cause ` can not be overstated ' , but said he will stay on his island regardless .
He said : ` On Necker Island we have constructed really strong buildings -LRB- with hurricane blinds -RRB- that should be able to handle extreme weather pretty well , though with a Category 5 hurricane almost nothing can withstand it .
` We had some lovely guests staying on Necker Island who have cut their trip short for safety reasons , and another group of guests have also postponed .
' I will be on Necker alongside our team , as I have been on the three times we have had hurricanes over the past 30 years . '
His main concern , he added , was for the locals on the British Virgin Islands - as well as the wildlife .
He explained : ' I am also concerned for the wonderful wildlife of the BVI , not least on Necker and Moskito , where many flamingos , lemurs , scarlet ibis and other stunning species live .
` Hopefully all people and animals can keep out of harm 's way in the coming days . '
Hurricanes , he said , are ` one of the wonders of the natural world ' , adding : ` The power of the sea breaking over the cliff tops , the eerie hush when you are in the eye of the hurricane and then the roar of the winds , the lightning and the rain . '
And the businessman also took the opportunity to discuss the need to support the Paris agreement on clean energy .
He said : ` Man-made climate change is a key factor in the increasing intensity of these hurricanes , as many experts have suggested . The damage caused by Harvey all over Texas is a tragic and costly reminder that our climate is changing and that we are not doing enough to tackle this enormous challenge . '


Scott says in a statement that the initial 100 troops will be stationed throughout the state . Some 7,000 National Guard members will report to duty Friday , when the storm could be bearing down on Florida .
Scott says tolls will be suspended to keep traffic flowing as residents begin to evacuate coastal areas in the potential path of the dangerous Category 5 storm .
The governor adds that tolls will remain suspended ` for the duration of the storm 's impacts to Florida . '
Meanwhile , Miami-Dade County 's mayor says residents and visitors should be prepared to evacuate Miami Beach , as soon as Wednesday evening .
An NFL game to be played between the the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday has also been cancelled .

Water and basic foodstuffs are already flying off the shelves of some stores in Florida .
Pablo Rodriguez surveyed the empty water aisle at a Fort Lauderdale Winn Dixie with dismay , saying ' I was hoping to get a few cases . '
The 65-year-old said he would have to try other shops , because ` all the people are stocking up quick . '
Theresa Webster , 60 , of Fort Lauderdale had heard water was sold out at Publix but still available at Winn Dixie , but there was none by the time she got there in the afternoon .
She was also stocking up on canned tuna , crackers and bread .
Said Webster : ' I got some water already but I wanted more . '
By mid-day Monday , many grocery stores across South Florida had been emptied of bottled water and stores were hoping to restock beginning Tuesday morning .
States of emergency were also declared in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where residents rushed to find last-minute supplies , forming long lines outside supermarkets and gas stations .
People in Puerto Rico braced for electricity outages after the director of the island 's power company predicted that storm damage could leave some areas without electricity for four to six months . But ` some areas will have power -LRB- back -RRB- in less than a week , ' Ricardo Ramos told radio station Notiuno 630 AM . The utility 's infrastructure has deteriorated greatly during a decade-long recession , and Puerto Ricans experienced an island wide outage last year .
Both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands expected four inches to eight inches of rain and winds of 40-50 mph with gusts of up to 60 mph .
The governors of both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have submitted state of emergency declarations to the White House ahead of the storm .
Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello says he has spoken to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and thanked him in a tweet for ` the attention given to Puerto Rico ' ahead of the storm
Puerto Rico has announced a number of steps in preparation for the storm , including a 24-hour ban on the sale of alcohol starting 6am Wednesday .
The government has also dispatched inspectors to stores throughout the territory to check for possible price-gouging .
U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp says in a news briefing on Tuesday that he does n't want to frighten anyone but that forecasters predict the storm could skirt the territory or even pass directly over it .
Mapp says people in the islands may start to feel the storm 's effects around midmorning Wednesday .
` This is not an opportunity to go outside and try to have fun with a hurricane , ' Mapp warned . ` It 's not time to get on a surfboard . '
Irma grew into a Category 4 storm on Monday , any by early Tuesday , it 's maximum sustained winds increased to near 150 miles per hour . In comparison , Hurricane Harvey had winds of 130 mph when it made landfall in Texas last week . It was centered about 320 miles east of the Leeward Islands and moving west at 14 mph .
It is forecast to begin buffeting the region on Tuesday and the US National Hurricane Center said additional strengthening was expected .
Authorities warned that the storm could dump up to 10 inches of rain , cause landslides and dangerous flash floods and generate waves of up to 23 feet .

In the Caribbean , hurricane warnings were issued for 12 island groups , including Antigua , where the governor urged people to evacuate the tiny island of Anegada if they could ahead of the storm .
People prepare differently for hurricanes depending on whether they have a male or female name , a new study has shown .
A team of Princeton University researchers studied data on fatalities in hurricanes in the U.S.dating back to the 1970s , and found that female hurricanes have been consistently more deadly than hurricanes given a male name .
The researchers say changing a hurricane 's name form Charlie to Eloise could nearly triple its death toll .
` Feminine-named hurricanes -LRB- vs. masculine-named hurricanes -RRB- cause significantly more deaths , apparently because they lead to a lower perceived risk and consequently less preparedness , ' the researchers wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Until the 1950s , hurricanes were tracked each year by the order in which they occurred . It was later decided that it would be easier for people to track these systems if they were given easily remembered names .
So now , each storm is given a name and they alternate back and forth between male and female . This year , the first storm of the season was given a female name , Arlene . The first storm of the season is an A-letter name and each subsequent storm takes the next letter in the alphabet . We 've had nine storms this season , so we 're on the letter I , Irma .
The researchers do not suggest a new way of naming storms that might address this problem . They leave that to the media and policy makers .

However , they say that educating the public on gender biases might help address the issue of underestimating ` female ' storms .

Vivian Wheatley , proprietor of the Anegada Reef Hotel , planned to stay behind . She said she would stay in one of the hotel rooms and take advantage of the generator since there were no guests .
` We know it 's a very powerful -LRB- storm -RRB- , and we know it 's going to be very close , ' she said . ` Let 's hope for the best . '
A hurricane warning was posted for Antigua and Barbuda , Anguilla , Montserrat , St. Kitts and Nevis , St. Martin , Saba , St. Eustatius , St. Maarten and St. Barts , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. and British Virgin islands . A tropical storm warning was in effect for Guadeloupe and Dominica .
The storm 's center was expected to move near or over the northern Leeward Islands late Tuesday and early Wednesday , the hurricane center said .
` Irma is a serious threat for the Caribbean islands and United States , ' AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said on Monday .
It is still unclear what path Irma will take as it inches closer to the US .
Right now , meteorologists say landfall in Georgia , Florida or the Carolinas are all possible . The storm could also move out into the Atlantic and completely bi-pass the East Coast , though that is now the least likely option .
` This hurricane has the potential to be a major event for the East Coast . It also has the potential to significantly strain FEMA and other governmental resources occurring so quickly on the heels of Harvey , ' Evan Myers , Expert Senior Meteorologist and Chief Operating Officer said .
If it does hit the U.S. , it wo n't be until this weekend , but residents in the southern U.S. should n't waste time getting an emergency plan together .
` As we saw just 10 days ago with Harvey , it is important to be ready to evacuate and be prepared with at a minimum , a list of items you would take if you had 30 minute notice or 1 hours notice of 6 hours or a day to evacuate , ' Myers said .

Meanwhile , government workers on the islands of the eastern Caribbean are clearing drains and pruning trees ahead of Irma .

Hundreds of flights are being cancelled in the eastern Caribbean through Tuesday , and cruise ships are being re-rerouted to stay away from the storm .

American Airlines has added extra flights out of two Caribbean islands Tuesday morning to get people out before the storm hit .
The flights were added in St. Maarten and St. Kitts and Nevis . Those are in addition to regularly scheduled flights Tuesday and Wednesday to Miami .
American says it expects to make additional flight changes as it monitors the storm .
Antigua 's airport has closed with an ominous statement from local authorities as Hurricane Irma approaches the Caribbean island .
The statement from the V.C. Bird International Airport says it is shutting down Tuesday and advises all visitors and residents of the two-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda to seek protection from the ` onslaught ' of the Category 5 storm .
It closes with : ` May God protect us all . '",Hurricane Irma strengthened to Category 5 storm sparking evacuations from Caribbean and the Florida Keys

Biscuit lovers took to social media to complain about the changes to the popular treat - with one asking ` Is nothing sacred anymore ? '
Some commented that the supermarket 's new own brand custard creams - which cost 45p a pack - are n't very good for dunking in tea , while others claimed the new ones are smaller .
However , Tesco has responded by saying its new recipe is ` healthier ' , adding that testers found their new custard creams to be ` even tastier ' than the old ones .
Fans of the biscuit expressed their anger at the new recipe online , with one writing : ` Why did you change your own brand custard creams , the ones in the yellow packet ? They were incredible and the new ones just are n't . '
Another added : ` Hey @tesco , I 'm not sure what you 've done to your custard creams but they are terrible to dunk in tea now . They used to be perfect too . '
Meanwhile , one Twitter user posted : ' . @tesco has made its smaller , IS NOTHING SACRED ANYMORE !? '
But not everyone was angered by the recipe change , with one shopper writing : ` My son Tom wants to say thanks for making your own brand custard creams even tastier . '
A spokesperson for Tesco told The Mirror : ` We extensively test our new products with customers to help make sure they become a real hit .
` They rated our new custard creams as being even tastier than the old recipe , and as they contain less salt and sugar they are a little bit healthier too . '

37,01f3d382064ea8fed7603ee74361d632e3b13120,"A fitness blogger has sparked a heated debate over acceptable gym wear , after sharing an encounter with a woman who had been shamed for working out in a sports bra .
Louise Aubery , who lives in Paris , shared an image of herself in leggings and a sports top next to a shot wearing shorts and a sports bra with her Instagram followers , pointing out that both are equally acceptable .
She was inspired after chatting to a woman at the gym who covered up in a long-sleeved top after a man accused her of flaunting her body by exercising in a sports bra .
` Do not let anyone tell you how you should behave , ' Louise urged followers . ` Sports bra have been created FOR this purpose , so please , do not feel ashamed wearing it at the gym , especially when it is so warm . '
Commenters were delighted by Louise 's post , which attracted more than 20,000 likes , with many saying that women should wear what they feel comfortable in without fear of being judged , but not everyone agreed .
Dozens of commenters said it was a double standard as many gyms ask male clients not to take their tops off while working out .
And others said that a woman can easily wear shorts and a tank top to stay cool while exercising , and that those who work out in sports bras are just looking for attention .
One man said he 'd even stopped going to the gym because the amount of women wearing tight and revealing clothing was distracting him .
` It 's hot , as in it 's sexual , ' he said . ` Sorry , you would n't wear it if it was n't . '
A female Instagrammer said she agreed that it 's inappropriate to wear just a sports bra , while another said that women should be aware of ` minors ' attending the gym and cover up .
Another more balanced voice said that men taking their shirts off at the gym is distracting as is wearing a sports bra and that everyone should just get over it and treat both genders equally .
Others accused Louise of interfering by questioning the girl over her choice of outfit , until she explained that it was someone she knew and not a stranger .
Louise hit the headlines earlier this month when she shared a side-by-side photo of herself in a bikini and highlighted how she sees herself versus how she believes other people do .
The fitness blogger drew arrows to various body parts noting that she believes she has a big nose , back fat and cellulite . In the other photo , however , she points out that people often compliment her big smile , long legs and strong butt .
The student explained : ` Whenever I see a picture of me , the first things which catches my eyes are my FLAWS . I always see what is wrong . `` Too close '' . `` My nose appears too big . '' `` My legs look too white '' . `` I look terrible '' . '
She went on to explain that when she looks at other people 's photos , she does n't look at people 's flaws first and focuses on their assets .
` So why not do the same with yourself ? We really need to learn not to be so harsh on ourselves . It is not healthy . I am going to work on it , and I hope you will too , ' she preaches .",Louise Aubrey from France shared post in gym gear with Instagram followers
38,de4373dc886db5aa8bbf9e56daf20714b24a22fa,"They may be a tad late , but the Lauren family still celebrated Independence Day this week with matching patriotic ensembles .
On Wednesday night , a day after Independence Day , Lauren Bush Lauren , 33 , took to Instagram to post a family photo of herself , her 45-year-old husband David Lauren , and their one-year-old son James , all in nearly identical black-and-white striped sweaters .
The Americana ensembles -- possibly by David 's dad , designer Ralph Lauren -- made for a sweet family snapshot at the end of a relaxing vacation in France .
Little James is bearing a toothy smile in the picture , in which he is perched on his mother 's hip .
` Smiles and stripes ... Traveling together as a little family was such a treat ! Even after 19 + hours of travel home today w a toddler , we are still glowing -LRB- and exhausted -RRB- ! ' Lauren wrote .
That 19 hours of travel time may have been due to the unavailability of direct flights from the Provence area to New York City . The family photo was also taken in a very green yard with trees , which is likely somewhere in the suburbs and not Manhattan .
The family had been exploring Provence , and posted pictures of the beautiful landscapes and beaches on Instagram .
David and James had met Lauren there during the last weekend in June for a family getaway . Lauren had been off on her own , visiting Africa for her nonprofit FEED organization .
Once together in southern France , Lauren and her family enjoyed an idyllic beach vacation , with James building his first sandcastle with his mother .
` Building our first sandcastle together ... Summer joy ! ' she captioned an image of herself sculpting the sand with her hands as James watched in awe .
She and David also shared plenty of photos of the beautiful countryside , including the ` serene ' lavender fields and local architecture .
On July 25 , Lauren celebrated turning 33 , with her husband sharing a touching tribute to her alongside a beautiful sunset snap .
Lauren also took to Instagram Stories that day to share her ` birthday highlights ' , including an adorable snapshot of her little boy wearing a blue romper , cardigan , and a white sun hat .

Lauren explained that ` dressing baby James in this adorable outfit and kissing him all day long ' was the first highlight on her list .
Next up was dune walking with David , and she happily shared a picture of him carrying his sandals while she walked behind him .
In the picture , James is wearing little sneakers to protect his feet from the rocks while he looks out at the ocean in front of him .

The final highlight of Lauren 's birthday was the ` other-worldly sunset ' that she watched with her loved ones .
Lauren was so moved by the sunset that she shared multiple photos of it , including one on her Instagram page .
` Just watched the most beautiful birthday sunset on a dune with my love ! Feeling beyond blessed and excited for the year ahead ! # 33 , ' she wrote .

Prior to the family vacation , Lauren was in Africa with her FEED team to visit some of the feeding programs her company helps fund with the World Food Programme .

According to an investigation by the BBC 's Panorama programme , traffickers are getting up to # 6,000 a time to move into new employment , such as training to become a mechanic , or help to set up a farm or shop .
An EU spokesman has denied that any cash was given to individuals , but an unnamed EU official told the programme off-camera that ex-smugglers were being given money via third parties and that the vetting system to decide who received help was ` flawed ' .
In one project , in Niger , the EU said it had ` invested ' 687,000 euros or # 604,000 in a pilot project designed to help former traffickers in the past 12 months alone .
The West African state is seen as the gateway to Libya and on to the Mediterranean for refugees seeking a better life in Europe .
In August , around 4,000 migrants made the dangerous crossing by boat from Libya to Italy -- but that number represented a huge fall on the previous year , when 21,000 travelled across the Med in August 2016 .
The reduction is largely due to the crackdown by the Niger government and the EU , which has handed more than # 300million to the country to help it combat those indirectly involved in trafficking .
Panorama found that , until a few months ago , convoys of pick-up trucks packed with migrants from all over sub-Saharan Africa would leave the city of Agadez , in Niger , to travel just over 500 miles across the desert to the Libyan border .
But following the crackdown , huge numbers of trucks have been confiscated . For each one impounded , there is a driver left without a vehicle and a livelihood .
Reporters from the BBC One programme were given access to a meeting that was overseen by Nigerian and EU officials where those claiming to be former people smugglers or to have been involved in the illegal migrant trade were lined up and selected for EU funding to launch businesses of their own choice .
It was claimed they can receive up to 6,000 euros each . One official told reporters that the system was ` flawed ' because there was very little paperwork and instead friends or colleagues ` vouched ' for the former smugglers ' identities and intentions .
A spokesman for the EU said no money was given directly or indirectly via third parties to former people smugglers .
However , she did admit that 687,000 euros had been invested in ` reconversion activities ' in Niger and that around 6,500 people previously involved in ` irregular migrant activities ' had been identified by 15 municipalities of the region of Agadez .
She said : ` People previously involved in smuggling submit reconversion projects that are then assessed .
` If they are deemed realistic they can get assistance that meets their needs in kind -- equipment , tools , livestock .
` There is no cash transfer to beneficiaries . Other projects offer vocational training . '

40,e98db57d65cc4f4381589f83dddaaea052e4fcd3,"A Playboy model who starred alongside Michael Jackson in Thriller is set to sue the singer 's estate for millions in royalties .
Ola Ray , 57 , played the King of Pop 's girlfriend in the 1983 cult classic music video , which has been viewed more than 437 million times on YouTube .
The former Playboy centerfold , from Los Angeles , tells DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview she 's owed 2.5 percent of the total royalties from Thriller for her role in the production .
Ray claims she 's been paid less than $ 200,000 in the 34 years since the iconic video was created and says she has been forced to live below the poverty line .
She is speaking out after Optimum Productions released the clip in 3D form at the Venice Film Festival on Monday , and is about to sue for royalties based on the new version .

Ray claims no one contacted her to let her know about the new film and was shunned from its world premiere as the company could make millions from the new version .
She now plans to bring the long-simmering battle to an end by taking the case to court in a bid to get what she 's owed .
The mom-of-one said : ` I 'm outraged , upset and in shock .
` When I heard rumors about a possible 3D version I contacted the director and said , `` We need to talk about this , '' but he never responded to my email .
` They have n't tried to contact me or negotiate anything .
` How do they think they can just do this without paying me ?
` These people are making millions of dollars out of me but all I have received over 30 years is $ 200,000 .
` They will make millions more out of this .
` If I 'm not getting paid , no one should be able to see it . '
Ray was in her early twenties when she beat hundreds of other hopefuls to play Jackson 's girlfriend in the original Thriller , released in 1983 .
The 14-minute short went on to help MJ 's Thriller album top the US chart for 37 weeks , selling a reputed 120 million copies and making it the best-selling record of all time .
Ray says she was initially only paid $ 2,500 for her part in the video , which she admits she would have done ` for nothing ' .
But she claims MJ promised her 2.5 percent of the royalties from the Thriller film , which was the most expensive music video of its era with a budget of $ 500,000 .
In 2012 the ex-glamour model was awarded $ 75,000 for back payment of royalties following a court battle but $ 20,000 of that went to her attorney .
Now Ray claims she should also be paid for the new 3D release of the video .

Director John Landis , who also directed the original Thriller , said the new film uses the ` latest available technology ' and boasts of the ` highest quality audio and visual experience ' .
Speaking at the Venice Film Festival , he also revealed that it is a preamble to bigger announcements and that two more Jackson legacy projects are to come .
Ray added : ' I was so excited about being in Thriller . I knew it was really big .
' I probably would have done it for nothing but Michael gave me a contract .
` Despite what I was promised I ended up having to raise my daughter , who is now 22 , basically on welfare .
' I have had to live below my means and in poverty because of this .
` If I had been receiving the money I should have received my life would be drastically different .
` They are trying to be sneaky again , but I really , truly believe that I will get what 's owed to me this time around . '
Attorney Scott Cole , who is advising Ray , said : ` It 's shameful Ms. Ray was n't invited and welcomed with open arms at the Venice festival .
` Ms. Ray had a central role in this iconic production .
` Shutting her out of her full royalties all these years hardly honors the memory of Michael or the spirit of the relevant contracts . '
Last month a jury ruled that Quincy Jones , who produced the Thriller album , was owed $ 9.4 million in royalties and fees by Michael Jackson 's estate .
The estate had contended that Jones was owed just $ 392,000 .","Ola Ray , the actress in Michael Jackson 's iconic Thriller music video , is set to sue the late singer 's estate for royalties that she says she 's owed"

Jose Mourinho had expected left back Shaw to return to first-team action next month after sustaining ligament damage in his foot at the end of April , but he managed just under an hour in the 1-1 draw at Leigh Sports Village .
Shaw , whose United career was in serious doubt at the end of last season following public criticism from Mourinho , was in a confident mood after his appearance against Swansea .
` -LSB- It felt -RSB- very good , ' he told MUTV after the game . ' I think me and Ash -LRB- Ashley Young -RRB- , we both really needed that . I felt like I could have gone on longer but 60 minutes was the aim at the start , ' he said .
` We were told we would play 45 to 60 minutes so 60 was great for me . I 'm feeling really good and I want to push on from here . '
Once he has returned to full fitness , the left-back will be competing for minutes with Daley Blind and Matteo Darmian in defence , but he believes that Mourinho has been entirely honest about the games on offer for each member of the squad in what promises to be a congested campaign .
The United boss was not at Monday 's game , though , as he took in the clash between rivals Manchester City and Everton at the Etihad instead .
Shaw added , ` We 've had discussions but the main ones we 've had so far are about how my injury is , how I 'm feeling . I told him straight how I was feeling and that 's good .
` He tells us all straight what he wants and how it 's going to plan out for the games we have . We 've got so many games this season and it was the same last season . The games will be bigger this season because we 're back in the Champions League and more of a challenge . We 're all up for it .
` Everyone is training hard because everyone wants to be on that pitch in the important games . We 're all fighting for a place and now it 's my time to fight for my place . '",Luke Shaw returned from injury in Manchester United U23s draw with Swansea

Jim Vos , 54 , CEO of hedge fund Aksia , has been charged with failure to stop the possession of alcohol by a minor at his home on Ponus Ridge Road , New Canaan , Connecticut .
Norwalk Hospital ER called New Cannan police on May 30 after doctors admitted a 17-year-old girl with a suspected head injury , according to theNew Canaan Daily Voice .
The head injury was not serious , according to doctors .
Vos was charged along with his son Hayden , 22 , and daughter Sophie , 18 , with allowing the party to continue .
The party , which was hosted by Sophie , was celebrating the graduation of students of St George 's , a private school in Newport , Rhode Island , which commands fees of $ 60,000 a year . At least two-dozen people were at the party .
Police arrived at the house shortly before dawn on May 30 seeking to speak with the injured girl .
Officer Clinton Jarvis said when he arrived : ' I found the remains of an alcohol party , which included the strong odor of alcohol . I observed multiple areas on the patio and lawn covered in vomit . '
He added he found empty Budweiser cans and Mike 's Hard Lemonade bottles .
According to a report on NewCanaanite.com Vos reportedly refused to co-operate with the investigation .
An arrest warrant application filed by Officer Clinton Jarvis claimed Vos ` knowingly had minors on his property consuming alcohol and failed to intervene which ultimately resulted in the injury of an intoxicated juvenile ' .
He wrote : ` After several attempts to make contact , I canvassed the property for other entrances . When I entered the backyard of the residence I found the remains of an alcohol party which included the strong odor of alcohol . I observed multiple areas on the patio and lawn covered in vomit , and the fire pit was still burning . '
The warrant claimed : ` Mr. Vos remained uncooperative throughout the entire investigation . '
Mr Vos subsequently turned himself in to police on June 26 and was charged with failure to halt possession of alcohol by a minor . He was freed on $ 2,500 bond .
His daughter then turned herself in on June 27 and was charged with permitting a minor to posses alcohol . Two days later her brother Hayden turned himself in and was charged with failure to halt possess alcohol by a minor . Both were freed on $ 2,500 bond . Both claim that their father was asleep and was not aware they were drinking . It is unclear if their mother , Stephanie Joyce , was present .

43,b9db332cb3e02d79cc4bb568b002758216db6816,"The ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex was too big to sprint and could n't outrun a speedy human , research has found .
Scientists have worked out the dinosaur 's maximum speed for the first time and found it was only 16.5 miles per hour -LRB- 26.5 kph -RRB- .
Thanks one mph faster than the average human , and a 11 mph slower than the fastest man on Earth , Usain Bolt .
Large animals take longer to accelerate , so smaller ones like the cheetah set the records , the researchers said .
Scroll down for video

Larger animals run out of energy supplied by the muscles before being able to reach their theoretically possible maximum speed .
This is because the acceleration phase requires muscles to function anaerobically , without oxygen , during which only limited stores of energy are available .
Small to medium sized animals accelerate quickly and have enough time to reach their theoretical maximum speed .
But large animals are limited in acceleration time and run out of readily mobilisable energy before being able to reach their theoretically possible maximum .

A study of almost 500 species from experts at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig , Germany , found animals only have so much time to reach maximum speed .
This is because acceleration comes from working in short bursts anaerobically - without oxygen .
And as this time is limited big beasts will never match medium sized ones .
The latest formula provide the best theory yet for why bigger animals are slower , a phenomenon scientists have previously struggled to explain .
The same pattern also occurs in air or water with marlins and peregrine falcons the quickest fish and birds , respectively .
The speed of dinosaurs has been debated for decades . Some scientists say T-Rex could reach 45 miles per hour -LRB- 72 kph -RRB- while others have suggested it was more like a plodding cyclist at 11 miles per hour -LRB- 17.5 kph -RRB- .
Now the study , published in Nature Ecology & Evolution , shows T Rex would never have been able to keep up with a Jeep as it did in Jurassic Park .
Zoologist Dr Myriam Hirt , of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research , Leipzig , said : ` Palaeontologists have long debated the potential running speeds of large birds and dinosaurs , that roamed past ecosystems . '
Her unique formula combined body mass , power and time needed for acceleration .
1 -RRB- Cheetah
2 -RRB- American Antelope -LRB- Pronghorn -RRB-
3 -RRB- Springbok
4 -RRB- Wildebeest
5 -RRB- Lion
6 -RRB- Blackbuck antelope
7 -RRB- Hare
8 -RRB- Greyhound
9 -RRB- Jackrabbit
10 -RRB- African wild dog
It calculated T Rex 's speed at about 16.5 miles per hour -LRB- 26.5 kph -RRB- - more than twice as slow as the much smaller Velicoraptor which could have got up to 34 miles per hour -LRB- 55 kph -RRB- .
The average sprinting speed of a human is about 15 miles per hour -LRB- 24 kph -RRB- .
Dr Hirt said : ` This is consistent with theories claiming Tyrannosaurus was very likely to have been a slow runner . '
The essence of her hypothesis is simple - animals have only a finite amount of time to accelerate from a standing start before they can accelerate no longer .
They find this is because the acceleration phase requires muscles to function anaerobically , without oxygen , during which only limited stores of energy are available .
Larger animals take longer than smaller ones to accelerate to their maximum speed .
So if acceleration time in the anaerobic phase exceeds the amount of energy that can be made available to muscles , the maximum achievable speed reaches an upper limit .
Dr Hirt said : ` Put simply , small to intermediately sized animals accelerate quickly and have enough time to reach their theoretical maximum speed , whereas large animals are limited in acceleration time and run out of readily mobilisable energy before being able to reach their theoretically possible maximum . '
So their speed is less than would be expected from their power .
Comparing the output of their ` time-dependent model ' to data from 474 animal species , weighing from 30 micrograms to 100 tons , her team found maximum speed drops off a cliff as animals grow beyond average size .
Acceleration is produced through the rapid conversion of metabolic , or chemical , energy into mechanical which takes place through anaerobic metabolism in ` fast-twitch ' muscle fibres .
So it only lasts until these fast-twitch fibres run out of their metabolic fuel - and the time available for acceleration is limited by the amount of these fibres .
But although larger animals have more fast-twitch muscle fibres so can accelerate for longer they also take a longer time to reach a given absolute speed .
At some point , the amount of time required to accelerate to faster speeds will exceed that available for acceleration and so faster speeds are never reached , explaining the paradox .
Moreover for biggest animals such as T Rex , which weighed up to nine tons , the time required to accelerate to faster speeds starts to outstrip the time available for acceleration .
This means maximum speed capability starts to decrease .
Dr Hirt said scientists have always struggled with the fact that , in running animals , the largest are not the fastest .
She said : ` In nature , the fastest running or swimming animals such as cheetahs or marlins are of intermediate size . There have been numerous attempts to describe this phenomenon .
` Although biomechanical and morphological models have been tailored to explain this within taxonomic groups , a general mechanistic model predicting the large-scale pattern across all taxonomic groups and ecosystem types is still lacking .
` Here , we fill this void with a maximum speed model based on the concept that animals are limited in their time for maximum acceleration because of restrictions on the quickly available energy .
` Consequently , acceleration time becomes the critical factor determining the maximum speed of animals . '
Dr Christofer Clemente , an animal ecophysiologist at Sunshine Coast University in Maroochydore , Australia , who reviewed the study for the journal , said : ` The exciting part of this proposal is it applies equally well to animals on land , in the air and in water . '","Large animals accelerate slowly , so smaller ones like the cheetah are quicker"

She said there is no succession plan as such and Ram Rahim 's adopted daughter Honeypreet has no stake in Dera .
None of the family members have claimed any share in the organisation , she said .
` There is no declaration on Dera 's succession plan . It will be managed by Guruji himself . The management is taking over all the day-to-day activities . Honeypreet has no stake in Dera , ' said Vipassana .
Vipassana also rejected the claim made by Jasmeet Insan 's mother that she is willing to nominate her son as the Dera chief .
The sect has already claimed to have no contact with Gurmeet Ram Rahim 's confidant Honeypreet Insan , against whom a lookout notice has been issued for hatching a plan for the escape of the Dera head after he was convicted by a CBI court . She is already in hiding and police sources said there is no trace of her .
Ram Rahim has requested jail authorities that he be allowed to meet a list of 10 people . Topping the list is adopted daughter Honeypreet .
After Ram Rahim was convicted , the ` father-daughter ' had requested the court to allow them to live together .
Honeypreet moved an application through her lawyer while the self-styled godman filed a petition . The court , however , threw out the requests .

46,7d71bca3c900faa783039cb514f4bf320100ae03,"A Texas officer funded his failed political campaign with drug money , officials have claimed .
Geovani Hernandez ran for sheriff in Hidalgo County in 2012 and 2014 , promising the locals he could protect them from the drugs and violence spilling over the border from Mexico .
` What happens here affects the rest of the United States of America , ' Hernandez , 43 , told the Rio Grande Guardian at the time .
During a year-long investigation in which informants wore hidden recording devices , he admitted to working with the Mexico-based Gulf Cartel and using it to finance his political career , the Washington Post reports .
He even appeared in a music video in 2016 for a ` narcocorrido ' - a genre of of Mexican folk songs which celebrate criminals - in which he played the part of a corrupt cop .
He could be seen performing a raid in the song ' 6000 kilos ' by Gerardo Hernandez which also featured several busy and scantily clad women lounging by a luxurious swimming pool .

The case against Hernandez began in August 2016 when a confidential informant received a tip that police officers - Hernandez included - were helping drug runners .
The informant approached the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement 's Homeland Security Investigations division and so began ` Operation Blue Shame ' .
A second informant was sent to meet with Hernandez in May this year . During the meeting , the cop allegedly boasted that he was ` close friends ' with slain Gulf Cartel boss Juan Manuel Loza-Salinas .
He said the connection allowed him to travel into cartel territory ` without any problems ' and that he needed money to fund his campaign for Hidalgo County Constable .
Hernandez then agreed to run license plate checks for some non-existent cars the informant said he wanted to sneak across the border for $ 1,000 , according to court papers .
Once he had established trust with Hernandez , the informant reportedly asked for help in transporting a car with ` items ' across Texas for split of $ 10,000
The cop told him ` not to tell him what the vehicle would be transporting , not to discuss any details on their current cellphones , and to buy new cellphones , ' court documents stated .
Authorities loaded the car with 10kg of powder , one of which was actual cocaine , in July and Hernandez did indeed help its transport .



He was arrested and brought before US Magistrate Judge Dorina Ramos on August 14 and now faces charges of aiding and abetting , attempt to posses with intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession with attempt to distribute more than 5kg of cocaine .
If proven , it will be a dramatic fall from grace for a decorated cop who first began working as a jailer with the Hidalgo County Sheriff 's Office in 1996 , according to KRGV .

Pir Shaami posted a picture of him and the Bolton fighter saying Khan had invited him to his house for a Special Dawat -LRB- dinner -RRB- and to ` make dua for the forgiveness of his shortcomings ' .
In Islam ` making dua ' means asking Allah for forgiveness by carrying out a set of specific steps .
The spiritual leader said Khan had ` made a firm intention to abide by the laws of Islam . '
It comes weeks after an astonishing public spat between Faryal and Khan when the boxer announced his marriage split on Twitter and both accused the other of cheating .
Khan also accused his American wife of having an affair with heavyweight rival Anthony Joshua .
The boxer was said to have told him the relationship was unhealthy during the meeting on August 15 but the spiritual leader urged him to be patient and ride it out , The Sun reported .
He said the couple should stop their public bickering and try to resolve their differences .
Faryal , an American model , had asked to meet the spiritual leader alone but he refused to unless she was accompanied by a man .
She later tweeted and then deleted : ' I respect and trust Shaykh Saqib Shaami as much as Amir does .
` He has not been biased previously and will do justice .
' I also respect Shaykh Saqib Shaami 's Islamic position of not meeting women to stop spreading false rumours on social media ' .

A family friend of the Khans told the newspaper : ` To Amir he explained what the rights of women are , what his wrongdoings were and why he should seek forgiveness .
` To Faryal he has said she has equal share to blame for deterioration of relations and that she has been wrong too . '
But despite the meeting the couple 's very public spat showed no signs of abating .
Earlier today Faryal praised Conor McGregor for his devotion to his long-term partner in a sly dig at her own husband .
She posted a tweet that included a quote from the mixed martial arts superstar explaining how he 'd been with his girlfriend Dee Devlin for eight years when they used to live on unemployment benefits .
Above the quote , Faryal wrote : ` Love this . I really respect men who respect their women despite how famous they get . '
In a series of extraordinary tweets earlier this month Khan announced on social he and his wife Faryal were splitting up .
He also accuses her of cheating on him with fellow boxer Anthony Joshua - a claim he later apologised for after admitting there was ` no truth ' to his claims .
Amir Khan fears ` boxing will be over ' if Conor McGregor defeats Floyd Mayweather tonight .
Khan is wary of the wider consequences should McGregor secure what would be the unlikeliest of wins on his professional boxing debut against the fighter widely regarded as the finest of the modern era .
His concern is that so may of boxing 's followers will thereafter be seduced by MMA , and that McGregor 's and the UFC 's present popularity also serves as ' a warning ' to the sport he has dedicated his life to .
` If McGregor wins , boxing is over , ' the 30-year-old said . ` Disaster , big time .

The organization has been promoting the event for months , and last week posted a press release on their blog that said : ` The Fashion Show will showcase the Expo 's top concealed carry products and demonstrate the features and benefits to an audience of firearm enthusiasts and industry media .
` Both male and female models will walk the runway , showcasing products ranging from conventional pistol holsters and accessories to concealed carry purses , bags , and much more . '
The release also warned that only ` approved ' members of media organizations would receive credentials to cover the expo , suggesting that certain news groups would not be let in .
The NRA , apolitically powerful gun rights group that regularly tussles with lawmakers over gun control , says nearly 16 million Americans are licensed to carry concealed firearms .
The controversial group insists that the country is safer when more people carry guns , despite schools of evidence suggesting otherwise .
Unlike annual meetings which are reserved for members , the three-day convention is described as more of an educational opportunity for the general public .
` It 's kind of this full , comprehensive look of what it means to be able to defend yourself , ' Brown said .
In addition to the fashion show , the weekend event has plans for a concert and dozens of workshops , such as one on how to stop life-threatening bleeding .
` We 're going to pull out all the stops , ' Brown said , to help people make informed decisions about guns and self-defense .
The NRA came under fire in recent months after releasing a series of videos that some believe use violence-inciting language and images .
The organization is using the hashtags #counterresistance and #clenchedfistoftruth to go along with the videos which use terms such as ` shot across the bow ' and threatens media and political ` elites ' .
The terms , critics have said , suggest anyone opposing their views are enemy combatants .
` The times are burning and the media elites have been caught holding the match , ' NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch says in one video aired on NRATV - the lobby 's web video sight .
It also shows footage of people fighting police , breaking storefront glass and burning the American flag to bring home their message .
She later specifically threatens the New York times , saying : ` We 've had it with your narratives , your propaganda , your fake news .
` We 've had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords , your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life .
` And we 've had it with your tone-deaf assertion that you are in any way truth or fact-based journalism .
` Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow . In short , we 're coming for you . '
Kathleen Hall Jamieson , the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania , said the tone and language is ` overwrought rhetoric ' that , viewed by the wrong person , could lead to violence . The kicker on one of the videos - ` We 're coming for you ' - is straight out of the movies , she said , and ` that phrase means that violence is imminent and we will perpetrate it . '
The NRA is taking a page from the Trump playbook .
This friction between the gun lobby and the media is n't new .
But critics of the NRA contend the organization is relying on the ` fake news ' mantra started by Trump to whip up its followers after a dip in gun sales that has taken place since Trump succeeded President Barack Obama , who favored stricter gun-control laws .
Some gun owners have cheered the videos and said they give voice to conservatives weary of media attacks on Trump ; others say the videos stray from the NRA 's original mission and that the NRA is inviting violence .
Joe Plenzler , a Marine veteran who served overseas and sometimes had reporters accompanying his unit , joined two other veterans in writing an opinion piece for The Daily Beast criticizing the videos .
` The NRA props up the Second Amendment by undermining and vilifying the protections afforded in the First , and paints everyone who may disagree with the current administration , our country 's justice system , or the NRA 's partisan political position with a very dark and unjust broad brush , ' Plenzler wrote with Marine veterans Craig Tucker and Kyleanne Hunter .
Plenzler , who has since dropped his NRA membership , said he was disturbed by the videos .
` Lately , it seems like they 've gone well out of the bounds of any sort of sane responsible behavior , ' he explained .
` If you want to advocate for the Second Amendment , which I unapologetically believe in , that 's fine , ' he said . ` But I think at the point where you are going to demonize half the American population in a recruitment effort to get more members , I 've got a big problem with that .

Researchers are developing an 'em otional ' humanoid robot that is sensitive to human touch and can read social situations so they always come across as polite and empathetic .
In addition to looking like a human , robots must also become more sociable so they can integrate into human environments , researchers say .

First results show that a robot is capable of inferring someone 's gender and personality in 75 per cent of cases simply by shaking hands .
In addition to looking like a human , robots must also become more sociable so they can integrate into human environments , researchers say .
The ENSTA research team have developed robots that can detect emotions and change their behaviour accordingly .
So for example when they can judge a person 's handshake by the stiffness of their arm and how much they move their hand .
` We could show that during a female to male handshake both participants apply less pressure than for a male to male handshake ' , Dr Tapus told MailOnline .
` The other features show that female handshakes are longer and have a lower frequency .
` What is also notable is that the hand of the male receiver is pointing down when he handshakes a female participant ' , she said .
Researchers believe this could be due to the fact that female participants are on average smaller .
` Giving robots a personality is the only way our relationship with artificial intelligence will survive ' , said Professor Adriana Tapus from ENSTA ParisTech , Université Paris-Saclay .
` Our research will help the next generation of social robots to be polite , empathetic , and maybe have their own sense of humour ' , she said .

` We are first developing a model of handshaking for women and men , for extroverted and introverted individuals , and based on this model we are able to infer the personality trait and the gender ' , Dr Tapus told MailOnline .

The team have also studied emotion recognition as part of a project to help people suffering with Autistic Syndrome Disorder -LRB- ASD -RRB- .
` If we can simulate a human like emotional response from a robot we can ensure a two-way relationship , benefiting the most vulnerable and isolated members of our society ' .
People with ASD often have difficulty recognising social stimuli but past research has shown that they find it more easy to interact with robots .
Using robots could help autism sufferers become more social .
This work also means that robots have the potential to become carers for our ageing population , work with humans to complete complex tasks and intervene in situations where human contact is welcome .
Earlier this week , scientists warned children could soon be ditching their human best friends to spend time with a robot instead , a scientists has warned .
It comes as a survey claims a fifth of youngsters aged between five and 18-years-old say they expect to become friends with a robot in the future .
Professor Angelo Cangelosi , director of the centre for robotics and neural systems at the University of Plymouth , said it was likely that young people growing up with AI and robot technology today would develop closer relationships with them in the future .
He said : ` Robots of today are a fascinating preview of how we might be living our lives tomorrow .
` From companions capable of reading our expressions and remembering previous conversations , to domestic home-helps that can go to the shops for us , it is really just a matter of time until we see ` deep learning ' technologies being integrated into robotics that will transform their capabilities .

50,f45f75a96eabef71300963c567c0d83686122531,"Twenty years after her death , those who loved and adored Princess Diana ca n't help but wonder how life would have played out for her had she not succumb to injuries sustained in the fatal Paris car crash on August 31 , 1997 .
It was a day when people all over the world listened in disbelief to radio and television reports announcing the death of the 36-year-old People 's Princess , leaving them to mourn the woman who captured their hearts .
Now , a new novel , Imagining Diana , published by Metabook , offers readers an account of Diana 's storied past , and her imagined future as an icon , lover , and mother of a future king .
` I 've always found Diana to be a fascinating figure . She was such a complex person who so many people thought they knew , but who was ultimately a mystery at the time of her death , ' says the book 's New York Times bestselling author , Diane Clehane .
Clehane , a New York Times best-selling author who has written other works on the princess , came up with the idea to create an imagined life for the British royal after having lunch with Diana 's brother , Charles Spencer , two years ago .
` After our meeting , I found it hard to stop thinking about the Princess and everything I remembered about her came flooding back . I realized we knew almost everything there was to know about Diana , but the one thing we did n't know was what would have , or could have been , had she lived . '
The novel provides an alternate reality that begins with the Princess of Wales having survived the wreckage , but with her famous face -- the most photographed in the world -- forever changed .
She now had a ` bright pink scar that ran down the side of her face from her ear to her jawline , ' Clehane writes .
Dodi Fayed on the other hand , does n't fare as well .
Still reeling from the accident and trying to get back to normal life after awaking from a coma , Diana would spend her days after the accident blaming herself for Dodi 's death .
` Now , because of me , Dodi is dead and his father has lost his only son , ' she 'd tell Charles .
She would have believed her decision to go to Paris , instead of taking her sons to America how she had planned , would mean the tragedy was her fault .
As she moved on , Future Diana had pared down and simplified her look , which sent a message that she was free of the restrictions she had endured for so long .
Her makeup was simpler and her hair was ` straighter , longer and blonder , ' Clehane writes .
The story goes on to explore her future place in royal life and her complicated relationships with Charles , Camilla , the Queen , Prince Philip and her sons .
It also exposes Diana 's true feelings for her former lover and soulmate , Pakistani heart surgeon Dr. Hasnat Khan , and her failed efforts to reunite with him .
The princess would realize she regretted her ill-fated attempt to make Khan jealous .
` Diana was angrier with herself than at anyone else . Her plan to try and make Hasnat jealous by helping that photographer get pictures of her and Dodi kissing on the Jonikal had backfired , just like Hasnat 's friend had warned her it would .
` Only she knew just how dire the consequences of her actions had been . Hearing the photographer was shopping his story , Diana worried that Hasnat -- along with the world -- would eventually find out she had orchestrated those photos on the Jonikal and set off the feeding frenzy in Paris . '
Months before her death , Diana had ended her two-year relationship with Hasnat , who she had described as ` Mr Wonderful , ' and had begun dating Dodi in July 1997 .
But the book explores the potential possibility of Diana wanting to reconcile with Hasnat , much to his reluctance .
` Now you are not only the most famous woman in the world , but you are the sainted figure who was nearly killed by the press , ' he 'd tell her .
` You are more famous than ever . '
` The photographers do n't want me now . Not like this , ' she tells him .
Hasnat 's hesitation to resume their relationship stemmed from rumors that she was going to marry Dodi .
Diana would eventually have to go meet with Mohamed Al Fayed , who had been talking to the press since the crash , about the tragic love story of her and his son .
` He continued to harp on his claim that the Establishment did not want Diana to marry a Muslim . '
During a face-to-face meeting between Diana and Mohamed in the British Countryside , she 'd insist he stop telling the public she and Dodi were to marry , because the lie is hurting her boys .
Al Fayed refuses to believe the romance between Diana and Dodi was n't real .
The book reveals : ` Mohamed was already there by the time Diana pulled up with Paul in her BMW . He was sitting in the back of his Rolls Royce staring absentmindedly out the window . In that unguarded moment , Diana saw incredible sadness in his eyes .
` She felt for him and did n't want to add to his unhappiness , but the stories of Dodi and Diana planning to marry , and Mohamed 's claims that MI6 , working for the royal family , was responsible for the crash , were making her life hell . When Mohamed began talking to whoever would listen about Diana and Dodi and their supposed wedding plans , he upset William and Harry greatly .
` They were still coming to terms with their parents being divorced . Diana had to explain to them that she never had any intention of marrying Dodi , and the news came as a great relief to William who , did n't approve of Dodi 's jet-setting lifestyle . '
Clehane goes on to explore Diana 's relationship with her adult sons , the arrival of Kate Middleton on the scene .
She would have initially found the her daughter-in-law to be ` formidable , ' and even felt ` twinges of envy ' when pictures of Kate 's unmarred , youthful beauty were splashed across the tabloids day after day .
Eventually , Diana would want to take the Duchess of Cambridge under her wing .
The novel also sees a new man in Diana 's life after she makes the decision to move to America . She 'd develop a romance with a wealthy , older American financier who asks for her hand in marriage .
' I absolutely loved the process of creating a world in which Diana lived on , ' says Clehane . ` And I did n't want it to be cheesy or tawdry .
` Although I know there is only the most remote chance that Diana 's family might read the book , I wanted them to know I took great pains to depict Diana as honestly as I could based on my extensive research and reporting . And that I did so with great respect . I admired Diana tremendously . I know she would have played an important role in her sons ' lives and accomplished great things as a global , humanitarian figure had she lived .
' I hope should her friends and family read the book , they come away feeling good about the kind of journey she takes in the novel ; a journey that could have been if only she lived .
